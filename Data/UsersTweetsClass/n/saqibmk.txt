it's what they call, the rise and fall. 1st, no march as its unconstitutional, then they said tht red zone is the red line, now they r saying pm house is  the red line. #prevtweet as khan saab enters the red zone with his followers, it remains to be seen how much the government is willing to concede, till the pm's bed? @_miasma o k i don't know about tht, but what r ur thoughts on stuart broad resembling ryan gosling &amp; alastair cook resembling henry cavill? unless u r a celebrity, twitter is like talking to urself in a crowded room. this ice bucket challenge seems so overrated. @bdutt kashmir is a disputed territory for pakistan, but not for india. whereas india nvr had a claim on baluchistan, this point is invalid. @_miasma won't u agree he looks like the indian version of benedict cumberbatch? rest in peace don pardo, snl will never be the same without you. bold move by the captain. giving up all the seats from national and other assemblies except kpk. 2moro could be finally crucial. why is it not surprising that government departments in pakistan practice corruption  even when they buy ink. the longest presentation interview in history of cricket for the losing captain finally ends. what's wrong with atherton? jimmy anderson winning man of the series awards makes it worse for the indians. rubs it in their faces. super humiliation for india after losing back to back test matches by more than an innings. #englandwin after wasting so many days we can finally expect some riots in isl. isn't this the entertainment the nation was waiting for #azadimarchpti joe root made as many runs in the 1st innings as the entire indian team. so much for the best batting line up in the world. just found another use of an umbrella apart from protection against rain and sunlight, it can be used for protection against footwear. welcome to pakistan, our most popular show is, who can take the longest time to reach the capital?

watson gone too. zulfi is on fire!!! #pakvaus very good start by pakistan, 1 aussie already out. 4 for 1. #pakvaus a very good total of 191 by pakistan. with their bowling attack, its easy to defend. #pakvaus another disgrace coming in for pakistan, shoaib malik. even he doesn't know how he makes it in the team. #pakvaus the disgraced akmal is gone for 94. great performance. the wonderful partnership of the disgraced akmal brothers comes to an end. #pakvaus an akmal makes a 50. #pakvaus @rujqmr mein eventuality k liye tayyari karraha hoon @hibamanzoor the disgraced akmal brothers are on. #pakvaus @rujqmr now what the hell is batfaal? @hibamanzoor @hibamanzoor i already m happy with tht &amp; i also acknowledge the fact its not gonna be a win for pakistan 2day, but what r u laughing about? @hibamanzoor how is that a laughing matter? lost the toss and here goes the match. #pakvaus #wt20 the torture is over for arsenal fans. its all over at the bridge. what a victory for the blues. 6-0 to chelsea. its salah now! wow! 6-0. oscar again! 5-0 to chelsea. what a game. 2nd half starts and it 4-0 to chelsea. hope they make it more. oscaaaar! great pass by torres. 4-0 to chelsea. luiz with an amazing strike but a good save from the keeper. still 3-0 to blues. come on chelsea!!! by the way, arsenal are down to 10 men so they r really struggling. chelsea scores on a penalty. its hazard now who takes the penalty after a gunner makes a save with hand. its 3-0 for chelsea. its schurrle now. its over now for arsenal. 2-0 to the blues. come on chelsea!!! the blues have done it. what a start. eto'o with a super strike. 1-0 to chelsea. big game at the bridge. the london derby, chelsea vs. arsenal. 1000th game for wenger. respect! pakistani innings had 51 dot balls. is that a record? i wonder. shoaib malik in the team is 1 of the major things wrong with our country right now. rt @iamsrk: oh no khushwant singh is no more. he made our lives so much richer by his literary contributions. “with malice towards one and … @time what do you mean by modern history when you are talking about commercial aviation? it has a history of less than 100 years. @ajenglish there is no rivalry. it's a stand off. qatar doesn't even have an inch of political influence in the world compared to ksa. getting a car wash in such a weather is a bad idea. but the damn bird poop is driving me crazy. @gulf_news because they come into being as a business and not as an institution. very much moved to see the honor given. they even named a street after him in rak. http://t.co/gaph3i5bpe @hibamanzoor my thoughts as well. if only there were more like http://t.co/vtkpcmox0t hilarious http://t.co/j2ageljfq8 @rujoomq yes he does. that's what i have been saying as well. rt @damonwake: probably shouldn't laugh but this is very funny. rt @samgadjones: amazing. the meme war begins: http://t.co/vbuei3gobz @hibamanzoor i said impossible cause they have never chased that total. its probably a surprise for most people. historic run chase by pakistan to beat bengladesh. great and unexpected performance. @sana_hs actually, bangladesh has a match against sri lanka on 6th and if the bengalis win that 1, then pakistan is out. @sana_hs then nothing, pakistan will still be in the final. all indians are bengalis today. impossible target of 326 for pakistan to chase. bengalis have gone crazy. why is @etisalatuae robbing its own people. data packages here are most expensive in the region. http://t.co/sdxrkcxsxt rt @bbcbreaking: ellen degeneres' "#oscars selfie" passes obama's "4 more years" as most retweeted tweet - causes twitter crash http://t.co… probably the most glamorous selfie ever. rt @theellenshow if only bradley's arm was longer. best photo ever. #oscars http://t.co/lwott9qybp rt @speakcomedy: i'm not fat.

my stomach is 3d. as much as i hate it, after all these years, its lala who wins it for pakistan. hafeez and maqsood both need to work on their running between the wickets. the collapse begins. sort of a dream start for pakistan. 8 overs, 56 runs without a loss of wicket. @sana_hs come on, don't bring luck into it. we have worked so hard towards our  lack of commitment, hard work and moral responsibility. @sana_hs also, 3 indian batsmen scored a 50. pakistan doesn't even have 3 batsmen. @sana_hs india has a very ordinary bowling attack but pakistan has an even more poor batting line up, so this will be a close 1 like always. it is an achievement for the pakistani bowlers to keep the mighty indian batting line up from scoring more than 250. all hopes r on misbah. very crucial for pakistan to keep india under 250. thank god rohit sharma is out. the way he was playing,  i actually thought he would score a century. and elsewhere, michael clarke has completed his test century against south africa. kholi out hogeya! kholi out hogeya!! happiness is disappointment on kholi's face. run rate has to come down significantly cause pakistan can never maintain 6 per over. biggest clash in cricket is under way. india vs. pakistan. @timeoutabudhabi @starsnbarsae 50 stars in the current us flag. @sana_hs we make every match interesting. its never gonna be a one sided display for us. rt @hibamanzoor: happy birthday, @furkanzafar! think to yourself that every day is your last. the hour to which you do not look forward will come as a welcome surprise. don't be hatin' there's this guy in england whose name is, captain fantastic faster than superman spiderman batman wolverine the hulk and the flash combined @iamsrk what is lolak? beautiful advert. http://t.co/hhrzteqxdb @rujoomq i m theek. @rujoomq bless u @jeremyclarkson yes, something wonderful has happened. piers morgan live has been axed by cnn. @hafshay would not recommend. papa john's is much better. @bdutt why are you expecting a unified response in the first place? @hibamanzoor the hahaha was for this @hibamanzoor hahaha @hibamanzoor thanks you. welcome to 11:30 bitch! http://t.co/ghtrztmwhs @hibamanzoor its ok, but st. regis saadiyat island resort has a royal suite which costs aed 130,000 per night. @warne888 http://t.co/lqoujb2gyg enjoy! what a sad news. philip seymour hoffman is dead. rest in peace, legend!
