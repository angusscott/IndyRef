kings island links (new) is wow!!! @samharrisorg has there been a delay with shipping the new book? http://t.co/sdw6oaccc7 @asusuk do you have a list of which motherboards can overclock a pentium g3258 anniversary edition? @davidcoker11 is that spelled correctly? no #elitedangerous newsletter today? anyone playing #thegolfclub and want to add me then my psn is:

bellesdale @mon_the_hoops @thegolfclubgame i am trying but it will take a few days to iron out the links. i just made 5 golf courses on #thegolfclub in no time at all. i will have a play with them and adjust them a bit before i publish them. in #thegolfclub the course creator is a clever tool but why does it create ridiculous 700+ yard holes? @callumlandells oh well pga tour is coming in the spring!!! @callumlandells who knows! i enjoyed it ok but it's hardly a slick next-gen experience. wonder how it plays on the pc? @callumlandells hopefully they'll listen to feedback and roll out some good updates. the crashes are annoying though. @callumlandells the course creator might save it. it's pretty impressive. it doesn't feel like it is stretching the ps4 though. @callumlandells the first course i played was crap but the second one was better. graphics no better than tiger on the ps3. disappointing. overall #thegolfclub has potential. i hope they keep working on it. look how far minecraft has come. the golf club 2.0 could be awesome. for £28 #thegolfclub is a bit underwhelming. feels like a poorly optimised beta. 60fps shouldn't be that hard given the average gfx. i have been playing #thegolfclub on #ps4 tonight and it keeps crashing to the desktop. not impressed. submitted about 3 or 4 reports to sony @kevinfordham thoughts on it so far? @kevinfordham i'll add you and give you a game tomorrow?

#elitedangerous when #elitedangerous finally launches i will be spending a lot of time flying around the solar system. hopefully filled with spaceports. watching the time of the doctor reminds me that no matter how good the actor you can't overcome terrible writing and companions.

https://t.co/ylqzaiqaoa

the implication is crystal clear. @obruchez seems that way. @obruchez i disagree. i think it was a more wordy version of the same inhuman, intolerant, superior bullshit. @obruchez well - imho - he apologised for upsetting anyone whilst re-iterating his view that people with downs are socially worthless. @obruchez exactly but some seem to feel that he's a spokesman for atheism itself. perhaps he does too? he disgraced himself today. @thechurchmouse i concur. when i was a catholic child @pontifex never spoke for me. now i am a grown man and @richarddawkins sure as hell doesn't. @sin_notung @richarddawkins @skepticink yes he is. @djgrothe @alexgabriel @richarddawkins there's a time and a place for such discussions and he's in no position to dictate what is moral. i think i'll give #elitedangerous a rest until beta 2.0. i'd rather conserve my energy for the full game. goodbye to you, my trusted friend

#pono pono may turn out to be the best sounding portable device ever but it won't be because of the 24/192 audio files but the engineering.
