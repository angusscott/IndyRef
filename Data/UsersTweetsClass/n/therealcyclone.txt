http://t.co/b1lfwe9fbt rt @3ree6ixty: i think it's important for everyone to remember education is he best way to rid ignorance and not abuse and slander. @clementine_ford i agree w/ a lot said, but, to effect real change, i think the hip-hop scene needs to address its issues from within. v relevant essay by @jessicavalenti re hip-hop's capacity to change + do right. remember @beastieboys' dodgy lyrics? http://t.co/gncaxgdqcl @rtnmelb @clementine_ford the dance scene, too, has issues historically. thrilled that @stereosonic has so many top female djs headlining. @rtnmelb @clementine_ford agree! @nme just covered the huge issue of women being groped at gigs. acts like @katyb can no longer crowdsurf. @clementine_ford women using 'bitch' in hip-hop denotes fighter, hustler, winner, empowered. it's been reclaimed. hip-hop flips language. @clementine_ford i've no problem with the word 'bitch' if women use/control it. context is key, even in hip-hop. i prefer 'bitch' to 'lady'. @clementine_ford @mbsarahconnor @3ree6ixty @sawngswjakec @tegandaley i'd recommend you start with @bellhooks' writings on hip-hop. ;) @clementine_ford what is needed is discussion/critique by women involved in hip-hop culture who can deconstruct its constructions of gender. rt @clementine_ford: @mbsarahconnor @3ree6ixty @sawngswjakec @tegandaley what does it mean in aus hip hop?

i'm not dissing any one dj. @impedeutc @michelleghunder @docfelix it did back then. hip-hop, turntablism evolves. cue @atrak, @djshadow? they reinvent, recontextualise. rt @mcrequiem: @therealcyclone no way. it's part of culture and art form. good cuts can show creativity and add to a track. rt @allaussiehiphop: @therealcyclone @benmartian agree with that. been wanting an x-ecutioners style album from debris, reflux and ad-fu fo… @benmartian @allaussiehiphop the x-ecutioners' x-pressions was so wild. there is so much that could be done. @benmartian @allaussiehiphop no, not trolling. scratching isn't always being used innovatively, but as a trope for 'authenticity'. @allaussiehiphop ha, good. why? hasn't it just been rendered into a trope? yes! @staceypullen plays @newguernica's selectors party here in tandem w/ @darkbeat_ on 4 oct. 3+ hour set. #detroittechno isn't it time for aussie hip-hoppers to drop the ol' skool turntable scratches?

http://t.co/pa6uoanbis i really hope, with @truebloodhbo finished for good, we don't have to again wait a year for the dvd. it's funny – @truebloodhbo was meant to be the darker, edgier anti-#twilight but peepz still wanted the happy ending for sookie + bill. being without $$$ @foxtel, i'm grateful having #spoilerland to suss the outcome of @truebloodhbo's finale... why do endings typically suck? i will miss @truebloodhbo. #rutinawesley (tara) is an exceptional actress - deserves leading roles. should get way more recognition. shopping in #camberwell feels so hip now that tom @bigscarymusic wrote a song about it – and w/ sax, too! #1dads https://t.co/otcglhgnvz been listening to the #1dads album about face from tom of @bigscarymusic all day. so subtle… can this guy do any wrong?

@naughtyboymusic + band! i may have also asked thom of @tnaf about @truebloodhbo + @cwtvd (#thevampirediaries) song syncs. no one believes me but tvd is cool! did insightful @tnaf (#thenakedandfamous) interview with thom today for @themusiccomau. talked la, #bigdayout, promo of 2nd album, tour... how do you replace an oz rock singer with the moves/swagger/charisma of jagger, morrison, nureyev + a panther? that's #michaelhutchence. funny that @inxs spesh on @sundaynighton7 ignored the awful rock star: inxs reality show… how do you replace #michaelhutchence? asked @katyb for story behind mysterious aaliyah song + about poss of future #magneticman collabs (unsure but hopeful), mo'. coming soon! @katyb's uk no. 1 little red = smooth cutting-edge house-pop (not edm!). love #innercity vibes of next thing… check it, peepz. chatted to @katyb fri nite for @themusiccomau. so authentic + unchanged by 'fame' – the soulstress next door. eager to return to oz! this fri's #slepton classic?

many australian bands are indebted to @inxs sonically, even a @tameimpala. they made post-punk, pre-grunge, funk... the @inxs bio-pic was ex - hope it goes os. always thought original sin with @nilerodgers was my fave song, but i'd forgotten don't change. again??? something is rotten in the state of denmark… #agiraffeisnotjustforchristmas. http://t.co/ltkbkvf2ln it's so depressing wanting to hit clubs and all your mates have babies or have moved to berlin or wanna watch telly. st valentine's day #slepton: romanian gheorghe zamfir's innovative pan flute theme from picnic at hanging rock. http://t.co/wyrcgl6qmg i'm not alone in raising fears of neo-eugenics + reality show-type circus re #marius + @copenhagenzoo. comments: http://t.co/blrkb16it0 just did intriguing interview with the enigmatic @slowwwmagic (a giraffe-lover, incidentally) ahead of @adelaidefest for @ripitup_mag. #ripmariusthegiraffe and children being exposed to this 'event'? can @copenhagenzoo be sure none are potential sociopaths? horrifying. #ripmariusthegiraffe zoos should be sanctuaries. poachers of elephants will really admire @copenhagenzoo for its 'fun' killing/feed 'event'. #ripmariusthegiraffe gratutious disregard for life and darwinian selection… sickens me being half east european - this is how nazism began. #ripmariusthegiraffe this has so distressed me, i can't sleep. @copenhagenzoo has turned it into a macabre pr stunt… was it 'planned'?

@the_hifi punters say it's a conspiracy. ;) great venue otherwise. last @lanewayfest melb impression: how is it that #footscraystation is still incomplete after how many years??? nice staff, though. food award of the day at @lanewayfest goes to @dig_a_pony_ veggie mushroom + truffle croquettes = omg. the lunch boxes were classy. no fashion sponsor (@topshop, @asos) at @lanewayfest 2014 is their loss. stylish countercultural crowd, as always. was scared @xdannyxbrownx wouldn't perform at @lanewayfest after tech issues saga, but he recovered. @azealiabanks, that's showpersonship. @cloud_control at @lanewayfest in melb had a huge crowd - promises sounded unreal. one of the best (aussie) singles of the decade so far. fully realised at @lanewayfest what an amazing dj that polymath #jamiexx is. great instincts, selections… was sublime. the hip-hop contingent at @lanewayfest 2014 was really strong, but @runjewels had the crowd in their hands. the alt watch the throne duo! best band at @lanewayfest? @savagesband. impeccable musicianship and mercurial performance by jehn. i'd really hoped to chronicle my @lanewayfest experience on twitter until my ph internet connection went (!), so here are my highlights... languid but appreciative crowd for @drenge at @lanewayfest in melb. the hipsters are sweltering! excited about @lanewayfest today but really hope #myki inspectors know about free travel arrangement so no stress.
