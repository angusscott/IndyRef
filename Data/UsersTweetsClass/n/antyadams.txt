@chilternrailway will the 6.15/6.18 trains be affected? @chilternrailway are all trains leaving marylebone as normal? what a great day out at the etape cymru. it certainly was a test but i loved it! #sportive #cycling rt @sportscenter: it's early in the day, but this fake punt td is a stone cold lock for the #sctop10. video: http://t.co/ozobnah4sb @irongirl619 too right. back to full training mode next week. tomorrow will give me an idea of where i'm at. getting a little nervous about tomorrow's etape cymru. it will be good prep for next year's @haute_route #cycling loving #thetitanics tonight at leam liberal club tonight! @hanrouss scotland currently takes out a bigger proportion of nhs funding than it puts in. to maintain nhs spending surely taxes will go up? @alansteen obviously but the tax per capita in scotland is lower than england. result = higher taxes or less spending on nhs #indyref #indyref question 3: what will the scotland policy on immigration be? #indyref question 2: given that the nhs is funded by the british tax payer how will the new scottish health service be setup/run? lots of questions regarding #indyref. if scotland can't keep the £ what plan b or even c has been tabled by @yesscotland?

i think its the wrong outcome but i'm intrigued. #bigbigdebate #bbcindyref @conorryan1 happy to have been proved wrong. do you get completely normal service and do you have to pay the license fee? what will happen to the bbc if scotland votes #yes?
