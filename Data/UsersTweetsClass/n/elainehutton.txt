they didn't show the audience's allegiance. @eilidh_graham @drumackay i'm calling bs too. programme never showed audience allegiances, do why would the bbc make that request? @craftygirl72 @strictlysid the programme never showed what the audience allegiance was. so they'd have no reason to request this. @juliam53 yes, everyone is entitled to hold an opinion.i was concerned about this story. few holes &amp; none of the other 8000 kids citing it @juliam53 yes, everyone is entitled to hold an opinion.i was concerned about this story. few holes &amp; none of the other 8000 kids citing it @samknight @drlfarrell i think godwins law should be changed to the first person to mention norway. @juliam53 wishing to manipulate the vote? or daughter has an agenda? @elliotwalker5 yes voter claiming bbc asked her to pretend to be no. any truth? seems unlikely as no indication of allegiance in programme. @juliam53 there was no point where they indicated the audience allegiance. so why would they do it? made up story! @johnscott100 seems unlikely. the programme didn't show any split. @manderpantz @nualaswan the programme didn't show a split, so i don't see why they'd have done it. no one else tweeting about it @kmrt67 but they didn't show a divided audience on tv, so seems unlikely @juliam53 just watched it and there was no indication that the audience had been split. so seems unlikely @cowpsy1 thanks. will be interesting to see how it pans out for her. @blankalwayswins they were tweeting about it http://t.co/upvcmhutos @jafurn50 sounds unlikely. and only this mother is making the allegation. what about other witnesses? @helgy2 @bbcdaniels @marksleboda1 allegation seems to only be from 1 source. what about the rest of the 8000 audience? @eu4indyscot why are we only seeing this allegation from the one source? @cowpsy1 slightly skeptical . they asked a room of teenagers with mobile phones to pretend to be no? @teammcguire67 @alexx_mcarthur @88celtic88 sounds very unlikely the bbc would ask 8000 teenagers to lie knowing they all had phones &amp; wifi. @blankalwayswins would the bbc really ask 8000 teenagers with mobile phones in a room with free wifi to lie? doesn't sound likely to me. @martin_rob1 do you think the bbc would make that request to a room full of 8000 teenagers with mobile phones? really? @claireontoast really? the bbc asked 8000 teenagers with mobike phones in a room with free wifi to pretend to be no?

@keeps71 @r_mccormack i think that happened in england, surprisingly in scotland they changed the sunday trading rules in the 80s. hoorah. oh don't fret @victoriacoren i have my telly set to record the whole series. @r_mccormack i am no fan of 0 hours contracts either. but i recall what sundays were like when i was a child. they were shite @wilfulblindness oh yes, it's definitely accepted. they'd not be able to operate this way otherwise. @r_mccormack the use of the word "demanding" is probably why many are troubled by this "culture" @gaelic67 i've not seen much about that so cannot comment. @wilfulblindness it fits the dictionary definition of privilege. those in receipt of privilege rarely see it as such. more often as a right. @mbfacts8 @bscenex blocked @gaelic67 thankfully they are few &amp; far between. we should worry about the pro-religion zealots. they're getting more &amp; more mouthy @wilfulblindness i'm well aware it won't change anything. it's just seems odd that they seem to have this privilege @gaelic67 if that upsets you, then i'd suggest the internet's not for you. @yvonnemurray yes. i noticed some tweeters were being a bit derogatory. but that's often the way on twitter. just ignore them. @gaelic67 provided they don't think it gives them political and social privileges @gaelic67 sorry about your experience. i couldn't care less what non-rational beliefs folk have. @yvonnemurray does their bible say that their god doesn't like bits of paper counted and put into piles? @yvonnemurray i'm not bashing their beliefs. just don't understand why they don't count votes on a sunday. @paisleysteelman can you imagine the outcry from the god-botherers if we switched to sunday voting. @yvonnemurray i couldn't care less what non-rational beliefs folk have. but such beliefs should not give social &amp; political privilege @paisleysteelman i wonder if it's an eu rule that they can't be counted before the whole of the eu has voted @gaelic67 @r_mccormack @innesness you must have been exceptionally unlucky in meeting them. the majority are very tolerant @yvonnemurray @bromptonrail it's holding up the result. do it's detrimental to all of the eu rt @bbcradio4: author &amp; tv personality clive james reads his poignant poem about life and death, sentenced to life: http://t.co/z8eqpyawjo @normanbonney. maybe he should read this http://t.co/nzppamntyx @r_mccormack smacks to me of them getting a privilege due to their non rational belief system @innesness the privilege that this area is being given shows that there's too much tolerance of their beliefs. @accts_cowboy why should they have different rules from the rest of us just because or their non-rational belief system @paisleysteelman or actually on sunday, like everyone else. it's making us look ridiculous @bromptonrail to the detriment of the rest of europe?
