@hacklyfracture i'm still thinking it's not a coincidence that we've seen a soldier called blue already. like if you google google. i wonder if you can turn the universe inside out by building mojang within #minecraft. @hacklyfracture i blame clara more because the doctor did it unintentionally, not knowing who rupert would grow up to be. clara knew. @hacklyfracture i think you were right about both of them causing it - it's a kind of predestination paradox. @hacklyfracture she knew from the start that it was danny when he told her he was going to change from rupert. she told him she knew a pink. @hacklyfracture i took that to mean that he'd already chosen what he was going to be called, hence clara's shudder when she hears it. @hacklyfracture that's a fair point. @hacklyfracture i see it as a lot more clara's than the doctor's, but note that he had already come up with 'dan the soldier man' himself. i wish microsoft would buy me for $2.5 billion. the main difference between #minecraft and #microsoft is that minecraft's windows work better. rt @ltsbowie: what have i done
