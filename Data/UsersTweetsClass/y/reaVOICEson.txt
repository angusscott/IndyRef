 @conservativela @darnell @soopermexican that fear you have that minorities are gonna take over may come from realizing that you are out of place in the future. @conservativela not even the most staunch racist conservative would try that.
 @conservativela @soopermexican @conservativela @soopermexican https://t.co/kjpq5nhegv what i realize is that you guys are racist #teaparty trolls pretending to be minorities. fools!

 @conservativela @darnell @soopermexican @conservativela what's the matter, can't think of any other insults other than idiot?
why don't you talk about the subject? too complex? you don't have to guess. @soopermexican just said he believes this nonsense. minorities prefer segregation.
 @conservativela @darnell a cinnamon brown man (black man) who won't say whether he'd support segregation?
 @soopermexican @conservativela @darnell how about segregation? you also believe blacks &amp; mexicans want it more than most #teaparty whites? @soopermexican @conservativela really? i need more of this sick and twisted #teaparty knowledge. @soopermexican 
mexicans and blacks want segregation more than whites. lol @soopermexican according to your racism chart, how does #teaparty score from 1-10? 1 being secretly supporting segregation. 10 slave owner. @asketballdvinci @soopermexican but if you're mexican and you support discrimination against minorities, there's something wrong with you. @asketballdvinci @soopermexican your belief in the mexican constitution has little to do with racist #teaparty supporters. your words: "my conservative friends are much less racist"

your teaparty friends and i thank you for your honesty.
 @soopermexican you just stated that apparently there are degrees to racism.
you can measure how much of a racist someone can be? @soopermexican rt @soopermexican: .@reavoiceson lol it's really sad and pathetic you think such things. my conservative friends are much less racist than … how do you separate your "less racist" conservative friends from your "more racist" mexican friends?

 @soopermexican thank you, it's a real honor to be compared to elizabeth warren.

 @pragmaticdude @soopermexican rt @pragmaticdude: @soopermexican @reavoiceson so you are like elizabeth warren? lol you probably wish you'd be married to a mexican woman. secretly of course, you wouldn't want any #teaparty friends to know. @soopermexican you have pics on your timeline that prove my theory. yet none of your "mexican" friends are coming to defend u @itsonlywords @soopermexican rt @siftyboones: @soopermexican @reavoiceson koch meximilation program. only possible explanation. and if you really were hispanic...

teaparty hispanic is like a minority in the john birch society.

what's wrong with you?
 @soopermexican believe me, google translate doesn't do your insults justice. be a little more creative with your spanish.

@historyinpics @geekeasy i apologize, that wasn't meant for you  @goldietaylor. good talk! i apologize, it was meant for @soopermexican. apparently pretending to be mexican is equivalent to claiming they have mexican friends. white #teaparty supporters pretending to be minorities to try to legitimize their "honest" opinion on twitter.
