(provided they accept it, which i hope they do. &lt;3) looks like i'm gonna be writing an article on currency for @wearenational. getting a bit tired of the rubbish from unionists right now. @wjbarter @h_bettsworth i'm no liberal but god do i love that man @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational anyway thank you for the fun debate, i'm off to bed. all the best x @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational 11m ago i was criticising the position taken by uk parties. nothing more @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational for me it's currency union or sterlingisation as first step. @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational i support currency union then indy currency??? @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational i personally advocate £ temporarily for stability then shift to indy currency on euro dependent on public op @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational i never said it was. i take the green position, not snp @matthewcarson @jte it's like watching a very bitter married couple @jte i bet you feel very on edge @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational yes then you agree we can use £ without permission therefore nullifying the unionist argument @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational where on earth would they go otherwise? @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational which then means living cost is higher for the average ruk family, which is why it's a bad decision @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational yes but having 10% of a currency's user base disappear overnight ends up devaluing your currency @greigburgoyne @wearenational i think things will be most heated once the fringe is over @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational well if scotland stopped using them where else would they go @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational there wasn't a question @adrianmcmenamin @wearenational i agree, political posturing to scare the scottish electorate is indeed nonsense sorry for the caps but i was very excited. am very excited. it's like a bat cave but #indyref. has anyone voting yes made a "natcave" because i feel we've missed a trick there #indyref @emmalouisenicol @wearenational i'll take eleven. hope you guys like the new profile picture! ;) #buchòir #yesscotland #indyref @greigburgoyne @wearenational hahahaha i still love that photo hahaha please help support bu chòir, add a #twibbon now! http://t.co/hljr1velkg @wearenational it's as if it's just a political move to stop us from voting yes... definitely not jamming to this beyonce mashup over and over. not a bit. nope. https://t.co/y3btebz0xb rt @wearenational: can you imagine ruk actually blocked a currency union and they had to withdraw all coins and notes. seriously, imagine i… genuine request: can #indyscot have a unicorn on the new currency when we do have one? i need a unicorn on my money. on everything. #indyref "aye, 2018 was a rough year. somebody thought it'd be good tae try out the zimbabwean dollar. it was shite." maybe an indy scotland could change it's currency every year. we can try them out. like taking a car out for a drive. it'd be so bizarre but i'd love it i would love for scotland to use chinese yuan oh my god rt @adamramsay: no plan b? here are my plans a-r for scottish currency. #indyref #scotdecides http://t.co/zwu7i2aqlb follow @jlewr for more major sneeze updates i just sneezed for the first time in weeks and it was very satisfying @bryonymcculloch "wot if i need ma passport to gan tae carlisle" @bryonymcculloch i don't mean to force it on people, but it is a big decision. glad that most people see both campaigns waste their time @bryonymcculloch i'm hardcore yes but god do i know that both campaigns are shite i'm not saying i want anybody dead but it would be very tense. i personally think the next #scotdecides debate should follow a game of thrones trial by combat format. @absity you run into your bedroom, panting heavily as you fumble for the light switch. *flick* he is there in the window. alex has found u just saw the "fàilte gu alba" sign. good to be back in scotland. &lt;3 @megathornberry currently considering chronological twitter! which murakami novel should i begin with?! rt @calumrkerr: acts of vandalism and theft by @uk_together supporters in the borders continue...  #indyref http://t.co/fqsusxqmzo insane. - “@guardian: childcare funding could be cut off for failing to promote british values http://t.co/xkj2hczton @guardianedu” rt @artmaccarmaig: former #libdem candidate for #skye says: "i can't think of a single good reason to vote no" welcome! #yes #buchòir http:… i am so powerful. not even the cia can know what i'm doing. http://t.co/bjpihp6bpw rt @irishforyes: during banking crisis, nobody in ireland said, "let's run home to mother london." scotland, be brave. #yes #indyref http:/… rt @daftlimmy: "let's stay together," said the dames and sirs and baronesses and lords to scotland with its 20% child poverty despite havin… @illystor crey
