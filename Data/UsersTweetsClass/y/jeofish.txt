austerity not an snp policy god twitter, you use so much of my data allowance! @unioncollec7ive accepted and forgotten, it was late and correcting your grammar was unworthy of me @unioncollec7ive uni is proportionately attended by abc1 @unioncollec7ive ... that intelligence means you vote no. could be other  unmeasured factors such as, e.g., socio-econ bg @unioncollec7ive all i've ever said is that presence at uni is not a sufficient indicator of intelligence to support the thesis... @unioncollec7ive agreed, apologies @unioncollec7ive as an graduate of a top uni, i'm sure you'll appreciate not all educational establishments are equal @unioncollec7ive cross referenced, of course, to establishment and socio-economic background @unioncollec7ive ...which would give an actual indication of intelligence @unioncollec7ive which is why i said we'd need info on attainment from at least scqf lev 5 to assess consistent attainment... @unioncollec7ive again a typo on my phone. hardly a killer argument as you pointed out. i notice you're still ignoring my main argument @unioncollec7ive no, i don't care but you're the one making assertions that education automatically equals intelligence so i was curious @unioncollec7ive ... making assumption without that data is bad analysis. @unioncollec7ive bit i'm not dismissing it, i'm saying it cannot be assumed without more data. that's all i've ever said and that... @unioncollec7ive no. i've yet to mention my academic credentials. you're the one who assumed i had none and used it as a put down @unioncollec7ive ... before we can make such a broad and sweeping statement @unioncollec7ive ... let alone something as difficult to measure as intelligence. which is why we need more information... @unioncollec7ive i am asserting that educational achievement in itself is not necessarily proved by mere presence at university ... @unioncollec7ive a typo, and well done you got me. now address the rest of my comments instead of ignoring them and insulting me @unioncollec7ive i bet my educational achievements outweigh yours, which is probably why you launched a stream of abuse rather than answer @leomiklasz @wingsscotland @douglasdaniel dutch team still the best even if 5-1 against spain was too much too soon @immolations do i have to? @unioncollec7ive oh, and it's "you're" not "your" @unioncollec7ive out of curiosity, what's your education level? @unioncollec7ive full transcripts of acquired and predicted grades from scqf level 5 or equivalent would also be useful. @unioncollec7ive all your table indicates is small correlation that is not necessarily indicative of causative relationship. @unioncollec7ive we require a full weighted breakdown before dataset is usable. @unioncollec7ive if presence at uni indicates education than finishing uni indicates greater education otherwise why bother? also postgrads? yes. come on colombia @barcelonanil @unioncollec7ive @sammf10 certainly not evidence as one could assume graduates are more educated than students or graduands @wingsscotland have you seen this?

and use plebiscite(s) instead? far more suitable given how our political masters view us :) @tomwaits4noman praising worth an -a is confusing in english which is why people use media and data as singular. also pannini :) @tomwaits4noman my point is that it's not a noun in latin so shouldn't be pluralised as if it is @tomwaits4noman people only say referenda because an -um ending latin noun is usually pluralised as -a (medium/media, datum/data) @tomwaits4noman but few have latin endings. fine, i don't mind "referendren". plus bring back brethren as plural of brother :) @dead_cells @tomwaits4noman and so is democracy so we should remove the word from our dictionaries anyway @tomwaits4noman but its not broadly correct. it's utterly incorrect. latin gerunds can't have plurals so a latin plural is wrong rt @paul_vict: @bbcr4today there is no latin plural of referendum since that word is a gerund and not a noun. dear everyone, it's referendums not referenda. referendum is an english noun (english plural +s) or latin gerund (no pluralisation) @stevesayers1 @comeonscotland @kingdomjock with the greatest respect, i don't care. please leave me out of future replies. thank you. am i the only one sickened by the #glasgow2014 banners proudly displaying the atos logo?

to be honesti don't give a shit#indyref time to ask ofcom to investigate planted anti-indy questions at the bbc &amp; time for all pro-indy to support #bbcboycott #indyref #bbcbias a good streak and some vin rouge. can you get a better evening? @astonishedweek @kdugdalemsp i'd unfair to point out that unionists floated over a single scottish ukip mep because john reid says so dear america, we have violent video games, violent tv, alcohol abuse, etc. yet virtually no guns &amp; gun deaths. do the math(s). yours, europe enjoying a glass of côtes du rhone. hard to believe its been nearly 10 years since i first shared a glass of the same with @drskbarker :) does john reid think all the indians who fought bravely in ww2 aren't commemorated now india's no longer ruled by wm? #indyref great to see luke chadwick at @cambridgeutdfc permanently bbc worked with no 10 to prompt obama #indyref statement. bbc claims to be neutral now utterly untrue #bbcbias @rpmcgee @beachthistle i'm not as anti as that. a pro is that it has a modern, almost scandinavian feel to it. wasted opportunity tho' @rpmcgee @beachthistle yeah, it is a bit out of the way. reminds me a bit of smaller scale ottawa parliament. failure to do this makes your abuse seem suspect &amp; part of smear campaign. interestingly only one side currently doing this #indyref if you are threatened, whatever side of the debate you are, report to the police: not to politician/journalist/composer #indyref @maggivaughan @andrew_haddow @dalkeithfiddler @mikethefifer @jamesmacm alleged abuse. @rpmcgee @beachthistle it'd make a nice museum/gallery/hotel, but it's not a parliament. inside is alright but outside: bleugh @rpmcgee @beachthistle i wonder if we can get it moved at some point @metaknlght cancer business? the us will veto nato membership if scotland votes yes (and insists on a quick removal of trident). where's the catch? #indyref @tylochan of course they will. to what purpose?

@ian_bec @sooze8968 personally i prefer green because i think it looks more positive, but i don't mind what ink people use or don't use @ian_bec @sooze8968 only other search results are about how the daily mail hate it, so i'll continue to use green ink for that reason alone @ian_bec @sooze8968 yeah, thought it was interesting study @ian_bec @sooze8968 this is interesting, it compares red and blue ink tho' http://t.co/vfpcwuebcp @ian_bec probably not specific to marking, possibly some research on colours and emotional responses that suggest red is -ve and green +ve @martin1williams i got hit by a rental car. it really hertz i keep biting the inside of my cheek and it fucking hurts @ianiwrussell we should always be reminding people that lamont &amp; darling campaigned against devolution @magimay007 @bbcscotland i'll also consider your point relevant when you show me academic studies showing the record is biased towards snp @magimay007 @bbcscotland also nice dodging of the facts there. are you aware of the different rules of balance our not? @magimay007 @bbcscotland also when have i suggested that newspapers don't need regulation? @magimay007 @bbcscotland evidence for that accusation please @magimay007 @bbcscotland one sitting msp and one retired sounds like imbalance to me @magimay007 @bbcscotland if you don't know all that then i suggest you look up 'equivalence fallacy' and why two wrongs don't make a right @magimay007 @bbcscotland as in, i am not criminalised for refusing to pay for the daily record. higher standards are required from bbc @magimay007 @bbcscotland i also assume you are aware of the differing funding models for the bbc and the daily record? @magimay007 @bbcscotland i assume you are aware of the different legal requirements for balance between broadcast &amp; newspapers? @lesleyriddoch are they going to get rid of the massive hills? :) and the turd cherry on @bbcscotland's crossfire shit cake? the not at all partisan labour msp kezia dugdailymail .@bbcscotland is so cutting edge that they're stealing cnn's crossfire idea which even cnn canned for being utter shite #indyref #bbcbias @wingsscotland and they'd still have to convince the red trouser brigade in their constituencies to accept it the tories didn't think this devolution was necessary when calman was being discussed. i wonder what changed? #indyref @sovereignannie that's possible too it's as if mcquarrie &amp; boothman are nationalist fifth columnists infiltrating the bbc to destroy its reputation. they're doing a good job the kezia dugdale radio hour is just more evidence that broadcasting needs to be devolved #bbcbias can't believe that @bbcscotland are thinking about having a show hosted by kezia dugdale. not biased at all, no sirree #bbcbias leopold of belgium, beatrix of the netherlands and now juan carlos of spain. liz must be getting nervous in case abdication is contagious! juan carlos' abdication reminds me of his stand against military dictatorship in 1981 coup. sharp contrast with thai king's weakness @rpmcgee it's definitely a miniscule fraction of scotland's share of hs2 bbc biased towards ukip because they're the "4th party" but with 0 mps. green parties have an mp and msps, no coverage #bbcbias bbc defends coverage of ukip by saying they're "no longer just a european party". they have 0 mps #bbcbias where's the promised interview with prof dunleavy?

(2/2) unionists gloating over a ukip won in scotland: despite ukip scraping a seat, scotland &amp; england are different, 10% of the vote vs 30% (1/2) rt @smur_ok: @jeofish @newsnetscotland david torrance the newly elected ukip mep in scotland is openly gay. please do your research. @smur_ok @newsnetscotland i am aware that david *coburn* is gay. he's not exactly in favour of gay rights, like equal marriage, tho' if scots want some comfort: ukip only managed 10% despite having an advertising campaign paid for by the licence fee #bbcbias #vote2014 @wingsscotland before scotland had reported any results, snp were absent from their total uk party list on the website. plaid was on it @smur_ok @newsnetscotland tho' it's ironic that you are pointing out that the popular option is the right one: who won a majority in 2011? @smur_ok @newsnetscotland but my original point still stands @smur_ok @newsnetscotland and in a democracy i think i have a right to hold racist, sexist, anti-semitic homophobes in contempt @smur_ok @newsnetscotland i'm going to assume you're not 5 and so you are aware that being popular doesn't mean being right @newsnetscotland racism, homophobia, holocaust denial, climate change denial, misogyny: you name it, ukip will embrace it congrats to all those people who voted green just to keep ukip out of scotland. how'd that work out for you? #vote2014 rt @a_darlingmp: great result for labour in aberdeenshire, i've been told. good news. gains all over the country. #vote2014 bbc are talking about ukip a lot tonight? doesn't seem like they're doing so more than usual #vote2014 you'd think someone with the surname smart would avoid opening their mouth to prove that isn't the case with his ban on steinbeck, lee and the war poets, gove's politicization of education should not go unchallenged. nothing will happen tho' everytime #gove opens his mouth, the reputation of robert gordon's goes down @wingsscotland near enough. ronaldo rakes in virtually the same as atletico's first team players. so maybe, not *entire* wage bill after yesterday's tragic fire at the gsa, we can be certain of one thing: scotland' fire service deserve our utmost thanks &amp; praise @nataliemcgarry can't help feeling if nationalised we'd have 100% coverage. why do we even need separate infrastructure per company? @ray_mcrobbie heaven forbid they should utter the word "welshman" that'd really upset the retired colonels over breakfast hidden nuclear accidents at coulport, spent uranium in kirkcudbrightshire, and radioactive beaches at dalgety bay. reasons to vote #yes @roversfour @wingsscotland or national debt is about half of qpr's wage bill and we've got about as much to show for it! @wingsscotland their total wage bill is less than one real player. how'd that? @effiedeans @xarundel what utter nonsense. academics are often conservative &amp; disconnected from reality: it's called ivory tower syndrome rt @utdshane: if luke shaw is not at manchester united by sunday then i will give everyone that rts this £40, i'm not joking. @drskbarker :) he is magnificently evil too @drskbarker when you find a formula that works, you stick with it. see also james bond @drskbarker good idea, now where did i put mine? @drskbarker @mhbeals yep. cathartic after a day dealing with french bureaucracy the denial of non-uk eu citizens right to vote is a massive scandal but nothing will be done about http://t.co/qml6dz6fx3 if you voted ukip for any reason other than because you're a racist xenophobe then you're an idiot otherwise you're a racist xenophobic idot rt @govindajeggy: top bloody work, glasgow firefighters.

quelle surprise! seriously: gap between now and beginning of ww1 is the same as gap between beginning of ww1 and the 6 day campaign #ww1 they commemorated the end of the revolutionary &amp; napoleonic wars by fighting the battle of loos / 34% dead were scottish #indyref #ww1 10% hate idea of scottish parliament, so always will be some degree of idiots in any country #indyref watch yes jump to 90% if the political reality of the unionist position was followed thru to logical conclusion #indyref #proudscots as a welsh man who loves his rugby, i don't agree, but if uk is the nation then lets get rid of "regional" football &amp; rugby teams #indyref problem for #britnats comes up every international match because if you think scotland is a region then no rugby/football teams #indyref @celebs4indy i'm sorry, i can't agree with that. i'm happy to pay licence fee money for understanding of our neighbours @jsteve372 if necessary, yes. why are you so scared? if uniting is in the best interests it will happen. forcing it is imperialism. @jsteve372 what is? self-determination. you do realise indpendent non-english countries existed before 1707 and even before 10th century? can a non-parent ever know the sheer animal terror of hearing the baby alarm go off? #4amfears @jsteve372 you mean sasha distel:) but no, knowledge that it wasn't british empire, it was english empire and 1st stops wales, ire, sco as an addendum. wales was 1st eng colony. my grandda was beaten for speaking own language #bettertogether make me laugh, bitterly #indyref as a pro-indy welshman just got told i don't care about my own country's self-determination 800yrs later. love #britnats #indyref @jsteve372 i'm welsh. so, you know, i'll bite: we care more than the english, so #cybernat ahoy: fuck off @blairjenkinsyes they've told embassies to push the empire, sorry, uk, so of course govt depts are briefing against self determination has bella caledonia gone down? another #indyref ddos attack? if i was slab i say yes and check later @jsteve372 call it what it is:federalisation &amp; fairy tale. you can't have unequal devolution, that's a bogie. where's it leave wales &amp; ni? on can only awesome it's a never ending journey during which our wealth is squandered on foreign wars &amp; tax cuts for rich #indyref i'll ask again because no unionist has given me an answer: if devolution is a journey, what do they think is the destination? #indyref @metaknlght another shambles? it's a shame #omnishambles title has already been taken by condems, otherwise could describe her really tired of labour lies re #indyref same old tired shit from same old ppl. do they think we've forgotten all their lies 1997-2010? @carolineflintmp @bbcgms largest renewables sector in europe &amp;  increased demand for energy, hmm i wonder. ruk not the only market .@margaret_curran also, invented victimisation has no place in this debate .@margaret_curran given twitter trolls have been jailed for abuse i hope you've contacted the police... they work hard &amp; need a good laugh @baffiebox @davidpbmaddox @alexmassie i support independence and i'm english so does that make me self-loathing? @davidcshipley @bevaninheaven @marcuschown but don't let the massed support for the welfare state get in the way of your fygm ideology @davidcshipley @bevaninheaven @marcuschown any one of the thousands who bought the beveridge report in 1942. @wingsscotland when we win this, and we will, just think of the look on their faces. portillo in 97 x1,000 @bbcsportsound the importance of getting bowel issues sorted can't be exaggerated. too many ppl embarrassed. nearly lost family to them rt @bbcsportsound: fletcher 'very fortunate to be here': scotland captain darren fletcher reveals the true extent of the illness ... http:/… @wingsscotland ffs. again? one is beginning to wonder if they're trying to throw the game @martin1williams it's ku klux not klu klux. just saying... i can't help thinking that it's worth voting yes to be able to wake up 19/9 &amp; look at the fear in the faces of the establishment #indyref wee ginger dug nails the dudley intervention http://t.co/3ipx2e8ohb #indyref rt @wilw: *cough* *sputter* *gasp* totally pho king worth it. *wheeze* http://t.co/bwmtmqhcim dear no campaign, don't piss on my shoes and tell me it's raining. yours, the scottish people. #indyref @robertflorence not saying the presbyterian scots parlt like catholics, but the act of succession was the cause of anne forcing the union @robertflorence to be fair, that law was one reason why the scottish parliament had to end in 1707 no report on bbc bias, no report on ft's conservative case for financial solvency for iscotland, yet the bbc are not biased #indyref rt @pdxinteractive: feast thy eyes on the informative glory of the first developer diary for crusader kings ii: rajas of india!  http://t.c… @finnmccoolrises "miaow, meow, meow, miaow, miaow, purrrr?" http://t.co/nh0mboiegy for every scot that remembers galloway at faslane there are dozens that remember him on celebbb #miaow #indyref @johnmcternan @andyneil_ i tweet that john mcternan has nae mates, he tweets back i'm wrong, proving my point #unionistqed @philgry @bbcscotland ridiculous request given raw data was broadcast from their studios. just go into the archives. nothing but bullying galloway's naw roadshow merely highlights his love of the wm gravy train. (2/2) #sellout #indyref galloway's naw road show is an irrelevance. his support for no is at odds with every radical voice in scotland (1/2) #indyref @euanmccolm galloway has not been relevant in scotland for years. see his pathetic holyrood run in 2011. lost his deposit my money is on a sudden hedging of bets when next few polls show continued gains for #voteyes @edgarstair @suncloc it's incredibly short sighted we will win this referendum despite #msmbias and then what? no debts will be owed. we will break the power of a criminal press #indyref will be right, maybe duty, of iscotland govt to legislate criminal press if westminster won't/can't. meme is of pro-union bias in msm. #cybernat debacle proving it. what for media in iscotland if they back wrong horse? dangerous game being played by msm. the momentum is to #voteyes they're in danger of being on wrong side of history #ticktock #indyref if bbc &amp; stv are hoping to prove uws report on bias wrong, tonight's #newsnicht and #scotnight weren't a good start #msmbias #indyref we have an non-voting mp's irrelevant roadshow on @scotlandtonight but no mention of ft report. very curious #msmbias #indyref those poor lords. having to wait 15 mins for a subsidised £9.50 full roast. glad there are no food banks in uk #voteyes i don't hate the english. i'm 1/2 english, but i don't admire a ppl whose political existance, from aelle to aden, is rape &amp; pillage well, well. i remember doing that a few times in madden 12 when harvin played for the vikes #superbowl for all that half time show sucked, it was infinitely better than the beckham h&amp;m ads. seriously channel 4: they're a crime against humanity given that's nj in feb, i'm guessing kiedis and flea are a bit cold right now @chriswarcraft though that's be awesome. second only to bruce willis dancing a jig on the floodlights @chriswarcraft i'm glad i'm not alone in loathing the half time show really, really couldn't give a shit about bruno mars. i want to see more shut out. there's a good reason cinemas got rid of intervals. rt @chriswarcraft: since @foxsports requested it, here's a picture of some of what we were eating for the superb owl. http://t.co/oefqwmswsv the 1/2 time show only exists for sponsors and people who hate sport. expect to see it introduced in a fifa world cup final soon all the teams the broncos beat to get here must be mad at how shit the broncos are playing #superbowl @neiltyson so next year *should* be xlviiii not xlix. it won't, because what do the nfl care about historical accuracy, but it should @neiltyson well there is next year. roman numerals favour additive over subtractive, e.g. legio viiii hispanis holy shit. the ft (yes, that ft) says iscotland would be better off than we are now. better together? my arse #indyref you've had the pros. you've had the cons. now you decide. which is the best indiana jones movie in our indy referendum #indyref raiders: nazis in british empire, temple: mine rollercoaster, crusade: terrible matting, kingdom: monkey swinging #indyref raiders: melting nazis, temple: heart ripping thugees, crusade: choosing poorly, kingdom: john "fuck me it's john hurt" hurt #indyref rewatched crystal skull. it's no crusade but is monkey swinging worse than mine car rollercoaster? it's shorter. you decide #indyref @ck1875 anyway, enjoy the football. don't tell me who won. i've got it programmed up @ck1875 yeah, you're boys could have done with some better kicking this afternoon. oh, well, wales it is again! (third sport mention bingo) @ck1875 seriously, some kids complain because i mark in a green pen :/ @ck1875 tell me about it. i'm in rangers country down here :( @ck1875 tbf hating partick thistle is like hating tiny tim @ck1875 even though they're a glasgae team? @ck1875 no? who don't you hate :) you can root for manning, but the seahawks have the better defense. try to get *some* sleep, chief @ck1875 fair dos. but then you hate every team with a passion that isn't hibs, scotland or the packers :d @ck1875 being called a "thug". codeword for the n-word. many on twitter didn't even bother with the euphemism, straight out called him that @ck1875 nfc is better than afc and  the racist reaction to richard sherman's passion is making me a seahawks fan. at least tonight. i will be away from twitter until i get a chance to watch channel 4's recorded coverage. go seahawks! i get a long weekend next weekend. why couldn't #superbowlsunday be that sunday? how the hell did i manage to miss the start of the #6nations ? someone was asleep at the wheel! resignations must be given! the shame of a pedant: people favouriting your tweets when they contain typos judging by his tweets tonight @georgefoulkes has been on the sauce, someone had best intervene before he punches a policeman...again no country has ever regretted getting independence, ever. it's like growing up, sure you'll make mistakes but their you're mistakes #indyref
