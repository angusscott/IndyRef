fucking animals @sandshrew13 @sailorsoapbox if it helps i did come into this debate two years ago completely without bias. i'm not a lifelong nationalist. @sandshrew13 @sailorsoapbox maybe i'll write you a quick overview because i do find it fun to explain. (it won't be too biased...) @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 which was a lot of fun to write about in my international relations module. @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 scotland is an great example of simultaneous localisation (devolution, indy) combined with regionalisation (eu). @sandshrew13 @sailorsoapbox being so wired into the debate for so long i don't know of a good general overview but i'll have a look. @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 and in practice most indy supporters are, in fact, internationalist, &amp; feel uk hinders closer relations w others @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 sure. 'nationalism' is loaded but is widely understood within scotland's context to be of a civic nature. @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 it's not like a majority of scots supported 'liberation', but even the hardcore minority never got to that point @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 but for some reason it doesn't ever seem to have come near violence or armed resistance. @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 there seems to have always been an uneasiness about scottish nationalism from the uk elite. @sailorsoapbox @sandshrew13 i don't know too* much about that but from what i've inferred from scots literature / very recent history... @sandshrew13 @sailorsoapbox which issue?

i thought jupiter ascending was out soon but on the day of release it was pushed back to 2015. this blows. @sandshrew13 i should probably be more diplomatic but i left the cinema quite bitter about how dull i found it. @sandshrew13 nope. you were spot on before. https://t.co/ozf91bbnep @_quesrahsrah avengers &amp; every phase 2 movie have been terrific but i've they can't all be that good. *prepares to fight a war on two fronts* guardians of the galaxy belongs back in phase 1 with the other bad marvel movies. since reading it i've always thought death of a ladies' man with @alanbissett himself playing charlie would make for a great film. rt @tyleroakley: today on skype, @realjohngreen used the phrase 'hot twinks' and that's when i knew he understood me on a deeply spiritual … rt @the_moviebob: rebooting ghostbusters is sacrilege, period. but if they're going to do it, this "all-female" pitch is diabolical genius.… rt @the_moviebob: ...you get to paint everyone who freaks out at it as being part of an innevitable mra shitstorm, and everyone else will w… rt @jonbradfield: next week: government builds crossrail for lesbians "@themediatweets: today's mail on sunday front page explained... http… rt @enjolrasthewimp: ahh. nothing like the smell of oppression and societal unrest in the morning my review of @thecuringroomuk- a bleak play that does its utmost to rip at your heartstrings: http://t.co/mcpyzoxqvo #edfringe @sandshrew13 i don't agree but prisoners is one of those movies that, while having all the required elements, just didn't stick for me. on page 665 of 911 of a clash of kings, by george r.r. martin http://t.co/2elngz9ysu the best thing about this format is it capitalises on my indecisiveness. i can include contradictiary opinions without endless caveats. trying out a new format with this latest review; the optimist vs. cynic in me engaging in discussion / argument. great fun to write! my 4* review of @thecuringroomuk; one of the most harrowing plays of this year's #edfringe: http://t.co/mcpyzoxqvo http://t.co/plnyxels77 i don't care what anyone says; there is no way arya's doesn't name tywin, cersei &amp; joffrey to the faceless man. #asoiaf i so want to spent my entire month in edinburgh seeing fringe shows. rt @owenjones84: what a colourful little death threat http://t.co/cezziamoi8 while i saw a lot of great #edfringe shows, the one i can't stop thinking about is @thecuringroomuk. such a haunting &amp; moving performance. rt @ukmarkus: such a beautiful night in edinburgh. great company from @insideonemind rt @whatagayplay: @insideonemind wait til the sequel ;) rt @ukmarkus: well i have to say @whatagayplay was brilliant. eyes popped out a few times. go and see it! exhausting but great day in edinburgh seeing a bunch of fringe shows. @whatagayplay was especially good; very creative (&amp; very explicit!) for my money trains are the best mode of transport humans have ever invented. smooth, comfortable and my travel sickness never bothers me. @oldglenbogle thank you! i'm sure i will. @shaun_fraser @anassarwar i jest. not to brag but in the dream i blew tarja, annette and floor out the water. #moveasideladies #itsmytimetoshine had a dream last night that i was the new nightwish singer. at the rate they get though them it's not so unlikely! rt @anassarwar: great pic of the #indyrefexpress boarding ferry in ullapool heading to stornoway. beautiful part of scotland http://t.co/6j… is it wrong to hope @anassarwar gets the same kind of welcome on the islands as farage did in edinburgh?

(recent science suggests all humans do but y'know what i'm going for.) every single 'scottish comedy' twitter &amp; facebook page are embodiments of the cringe &amp; impossible to find funny. rt @animaldrumss: sick of this culture of "swag" and "the instagram". i prefer to enjoy art that actually makes me think, like that statue … rt @jonnysun: a seemingly perfect utopia immediatley becoms a dystopia when u find out evryone refers to eachother by watever their first e… rt @stvglasgow: several @scotrail stations are set for a #glasgow2014 makeover. falkirk high-er, anyone? http://t.co/rtbezpsher http://t.co… it feels nice to have a new book review up. world war z: an oral history of the zombie war by max brooks http://t.co/puo5ky5az0 enjoy. rt @amy__macdonald: everyone heading to @tinthepark have a great time and give balado a bloody good send off! so many happy memories were m… oh, cool! they read out my #askcenk question on tyt this week. @cenkuygur's reaction to hearing it is great. http://t.co/ucut6tmztj (3:04) rt @jamesrocchi: "aside from how it was filmed, boyhood is just okay." = “aside from how it has magical powers &amp; a cool horn, a unicorn is … rt @microsff: we are all individuals, we have tuned our originality, to be exactly 5.3% different. except bob. he is the only who refused t… rt @avabandofficial: here's @celcafe's list of top 10 angels &amp; airwaves songs.. does it match you favorites?  http://t.co/812qlvklhl rt @celebs4indy: john curtice 'last month’s poll was not necessarily an aberration.. supporters of independence are now tantalizingly close… "ernest hemingway once wrote, 'the world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' i agree with the second part." #se7en trying to get back into the swing of writing so i wrote up a quick book review of world war z by max brooks. http://t.co/puo5ky5az0 #zombies @bcndblchzburger @owenjones84 @pennyred you need to reach the point where people are willing to pay you to do that though. as a yes voter am i allowed to enjoy the braveheart soundtrack? or is anything to do with that movie to be avoided at all costs? @yeswithdex sorry to hear that.
