#indyref if you're campaigning tomorrow, remember: leave the voters to vote in peace. @derecthompson glad to hear it. make sure your volunteers know this is not a campaign day. people trying to vote must not be hindered. @derecthompson #indyref a voter, who like everyone else expects to be able to vote unmolested, as is our democratic right. @derecthompson @yesrutherglen #indyref if i see a single yes or no person harassing voters, there will be words and justified anger. #indyref gordon brown's speech was a sight to see https://t.co/rfor7erber @mr_eric_shaun @1888_originals where politicians are concerned? mediocrity is what you get. #indyref @nicolasturgeon i don't think any voter should be persuaded or dissuaded tomorrow.  let them vote in peace. #indyref whichever side you are on, i will remind you there must be no canvassing or harassment of any voter tomorrow. @mr_eric_shaun @1888_originals lol, yea i get that a lot.  plan for the worst, hope for the best, the outcome is somewhere in the middle. #indyref despite new developments scotland has lost almost 1k bbl/day every day since the oil production peak. @sean_muaythai @1888_originals @thescotsman you too, we live in such strange and exciting times. @sean_muaythai @1888_originals @thescotsman #indyref i would try not to bet our future on things not yet invented, not exactly sound. @sean_muaythai @1888_originals @thescotsman is there 4m bbl a day, everyday for the next 20 years? if no, there's a problem. #indyref @stuartlussi #indyref we can start a petition. @stuartlussi #indyref friday night, maybe? @1888_originals #indyref optimistic rhetoric. 3 million barrels a day, from 97. clare would be exhausted in 100 days at that rate. @1888_originals by the way the first part of clare can only produce 250 mmbl. from almost 2 billion, just 10%. #indyref @1888_originals scotland will need to start 300k barrels of new production, every year to stop the decline. #nothappening #indyref @1888_originals look at miller, 300 million barrels still down there, and no way in hell to get them out. got it? #indyref @1888_originals  if the #indyref had been held 40 years ago, scot would have had a case, but this is now and the answer is #no. @1888_originals #indyref this is not the 1970s and oil is not infinite magic juice.  it's a rare commodity that's expensive to produce. @gorge1969 #indyref the problem with polls; at 24 of 35 questioned you're calling it.  if the other 11 say no, they win. @tonigiugliano pft  #indyref oil and gas down 75% in little over 10 years, good luck with that. #indyref for those confused on oil production, the miller field is the perfect case in point. http://t.co/g7jfgvhirk @lindasgrant well i'm a no. i don't know about other artists, but i think it's better to have access to international markets and funding. @dustin_benton indeed, scotland uses a lot of energy, and doesn't produce much of a surplus. @sean_muaythai @thescotsman pft, when it tops 4 million barrels a day, give me a call. @brewakingtwit24 oh really. #indyref so none of those currencies have collapsed, or got to the brink of collapse? fantasy. @rydooo read the scottish govt and treasury's reports, they're available online. @rydooo @sean_muaythai @thescotsman and a 5% annual production decline over 15 years. @rydooo @sean_muaythai @thescotsman the treasury's last few royalties which were barely over 1bn. @c_werth #indyref, excellent.  i am sorely tempted to remove every one i see. @toady @judywhittaker #indyref tell him it gets its pocket money from england. @toady @judywhittaker lol, sounds like the yes camp's ideas and questions #indyref @andy_willmer excellent, i knew they'd eventually see that.  was my argument from 3 years ago. @redgerry yes, you talk about freedom and rights; they have the right an the freedom.  stem the hypocrisy. @redgerry #indyref brown was the pm, and is a scot.  darling is a scot.  they have every right.  you shush now. @weecolliedug #indyref oh no you don't, you're going to personally remove every yes sticker and poster from public property. #indyref do not under any circumstances vote more than once.  it will invalidate the result and make a mockery of the process @sean_muaythai @thescotsman an indy scotland will be lucky if it can get £30bn in oil taxes in 25 years. @thescotsman #indyref overall production is down 75%, 5% decline a year.  you know what happens when dwindling supplies meet rising costs. @thescotsman that's assuming that 100% can be extracted, and the govt takes every penny, it's not reality.  #indyref. here's a soft piano theme, enjoy. https://t.co/ql5ynmzm1k used duduk a lot for that episode, gives it a nice haunting quality. just a couple more minutes left to score, and i'm done. @sam33ral i see, pensioners freezing to death #voteyes #indyref going to go and practice on new church organ, 4x the size of the previous church's, eek. @sam33ral hopefully the oil prices won't go up too much, winter's just around the corner and folks have to pay for heating. @sam33ral #indyref england gets its fuel the same place scotland does...saudi arabia. produced oil is far too valuable not to export. @hensoncompany congrats, may it be very successful.  looks like a great cast and crew. @sianweather thanks for the follow. i enjoy your forecasts, and you're a trekker too which is awesome. rt @kevverage: this is a wonderful piece on #indyref please read &amp; rt:

@carolemagoha @markvchayne scotland has 10% of the uk population, therefore should have to pay 10% of the costs. it's only fair. #indyref instead of 1 country facing massive cuts, we all take a small cut which though painful is survivable. @carolemagoha @markvchayne minus barnet and eu payments the deficit inflates significantly upwards of 30 billion. @carolemagoha @markvchayne oil revenue 1 billion, current deficit 6 billion.  it's not enough. #indyref one of the main advantages of union, is that scotland's debt is added to the uks overall deficit. @carolemagoha @markvchayne the treasury currently adds it to the uk national debt, or pays it off through other sources of uk revenue @carolemagoha @markvchayne because you have a deficit, which the treasury is covering.  spending exceeds income therefore you borrow. @markvchayne #indyref that little book is wrong.  scotland is indebted to the uk annually, by billions of pounds. rt @mexodox: amazing energy from #yes camp. getting a real feel for what it must have been like in germany in the 1930s #indyref #nationali… @billymckenna1 1 house can only self check, it's a bit like self-marking. @billymckenna1 a bicameral house is safer than unicameral. @billymckenna1 the scottish parliament costs 71 million a year and rising, there's a good source of funding. @billymckenna1 on the contrary, i make full use of it. @billymckenna1 i don't like the practices more than anyone else, but yea it's still a no.i'd rather have a funded hospital than no hospital. @billymckenna1 wrong, it affects everyone.  the nhs will not be privatised, it is political suicide and all parties know that. @billymckenna1 no, i don't.  deep rooted values gleaned from decades of experience don't get changed cause a politician made a promise. @michaelthedug with a 6 to 30 billion pound annual deficit cuts will be made, and healthcare is expensive, so is education. @michaelthedug under a nation with a huge annual deficit, it's not going to survive indy either. @michaelthedug i'd rather it survived with a reliable source of funding, public, private or otherwise, preferably public. @michaelthedug #voteno so you listen to the people who work for and use the nhs. @michaelthedug maybe you should talk to some people who served the nhs for 30 years, taught in universities before that etc @michaelthedug come again, on second thoughts, don't. @michaelthedug #indyref i'll think of my mum, who was a no voter, a doctor, a community health specialist, and died of cancer 6 months ago. @lindawhitson1 @stevesayers1 @thewatcherthfc #indyref the entire children's register will need to be error checked before thursday @hamishj8 with a 75% decline in 15 years, scotland's oil will last at most 10-15 years. #indyref not convinced with the west coast thing.  denying exploration along an entire coast over a river, seems very 'does not compute'. @jim0203 @fergles @richardadalton #indyref i bet on yes, incase they won, so i could profit from it. @endless_psych #indyref ooh, every impartial article should begin with "posh edinburgh cricket types" i like my articles unbiased and clean. @moh_kohn @kidecono #indyref renewable potential is like oil reserves. @susanas4321 #indyref scottish parliament costs 6 million a month, could also be spent on that. @kidecono good point. @ayenaw2014 so no is 4 % positive?

#indyref if the yes and no camps boycott each other's products no company can do business in scotland. it's a bad message to send. @morrison_derek1 i want something more, something bigger than scotland.  which is why i'm voting no. @tomallan @greigaitken i know, there's a little more to it than that, but yea a bit rejected/betrayed. @tomallan @greigaitken no, it means i'd struggle to stay in scotland. @tomallan @greigaitken you're being asked to give more powers to politicians, i'm being asked to give up my country and birthplace. @tomallan @greigaitken and yea, i do feel in the post independence mess, i would loose access to some markets. @tomallan @greigaitken but in a couple of years.  indy puts that in question. @tomallan @greigaitken it would create a lot of uncertainty over a number of years.  i was planning to move to london permanently anyway @tomallan @greigaitken the article only touches on a few choice points.  i rely on britain's reputation with the us and europe, also asia. @calvertnc @politico #indyref the empire ended 30 years ago, where have you been?

@tomallan a little artistic hyperbole.  it would certainly not be good. @scotlandclare our democracy, we will all say what goes on in our democracy, that's democracy.  shame on you. @scotlandclare your culture, your composers.  when you throw away everything, there's nothing left. @rossmatthews86 oh yes canvassing, sounds like a reliable source. rt @cptfrootcake: alex salmond just likened the #indyref to apartheid. why anyone would want him as a leader is beyond me. what a pleb. @wolfdove1016 with what, optimism and patriotic dance?

no high speed choo choo, i'm fed up of paying 600 quid to get from the arse end of nowhere to somewhere. @frawil66 of course, we've paid for a sprawling bureaucracy and are about to vote for more, might as well make use of it. @frawil66 bridges made from rose bush cuttings, interesting.  i'm not against it, it's a great idea, i just want to know the details. @sgoilear yes damn those pesky scottish companies with their scottish employees #indyref @frawil66 and what will sir be paying for his extravagant purchases with? @royrodel1 they don't know what freedom is, or the responsibilities and consequences that go with it.  it's just a word. @jamesthornbury yea, the internet's full of racists and bigots, oh my! perish the thought. @redscarebot @royrodel1 i rest my case @mackay_alex it's worth 1 billion a year in royalties, and it will reduce to a trickle in 10 years.  you can't extract more than 65% @royrodel1 if you base your future on how you thought in school, you're in deep trouble.  #indyref @mkla45 must be awkward, all that silence. #indyref @jamesthornbury @macnessie there's only one thing worse than an independent scotland, and that's an independent socialist scotland. @jamesthornbury no the funniest thing is that you think a liberal capitalist believes in socialism. @jamesthornbury @macnessie not at all,  i believe in the greatest gain at the smallest possible cost. @jamesthornbury @macnessie not at all, public services and defence are cheaper provided and paid through taxes. @tongs_ya_bass in politics, never miss an opportunity to screw your enemies, especially when they're you're friends. @jamesthornbury @macnessie in brief: socialism takes money, power and freedom from individuals and gives it to the state. @jamesthornbury @macnessie because i used the word sense there. if it's actually socialist, that would do incredible harm to the country. @jamesthornbury @macnessie those with sense were on the winning side, but every party has their loonies. @macnessie @jamesthornbury i think both wings have caused enough damage. @macnessie @jamesthornbury one cold war was enough #nothanks @macca1877 aberdeen's a no, it's our oil. #indyref @jamesthornbury nice try, still #notbuyingit @scotlandclare  we're having a referendum, one of the most democratic things a country can do.  dictatorships don't hold referenda.#indyref #indyref saying the snp have nothing to do with independence, is like saying banks have nothing to do with money.  #notfallingforit @eurobubbler @goonereighty @calumforbes see and in looking we find that adopting eu law is only the first step towards negotiation. @3solipsists won't it get awfy soggy under your mattress?

a 14k army is nothing, a 200k army is barely anything. @joantfon @yeskippen don't suppose an oil and gas starved nuclear superpower would be interested do you? #indyref @yeskippen defenceless, very defenceless.  #indyref imagine??  scotland was bankrupt from darien and other slight mishaps, hence the union in the first place.  #indyref @jasondolan impassioned belief, and common sense are very different. #indyref @joantfon @jasondolan cnd/independence were accosting at bus stops.  i said "no thanks, we've got common sense" got a good laugh. @jasondolan have common sense, vote no. #indyref @joantfon @modernscotsman too bad, you're stuck with them, snp won't kick them out, independence or not. @modernscotsman @alexsalmond uk != britain, independence != republic, is that so alex? @dair_allan racism should have no place in any country, not just scotland and england. #indyref @cathal83 screw the ouija, fetch the spades. @cathal83 that's it then; i'll argue with the misguided, but no-one questions the 8-ball. #indyref @hktuff @hugorifkind scots outside are likely to understand scotland's role in britain and the world, so would likely vote no. @dair_allan yea those pesky english, writing in their english papers, about their english viewpoints, boo england. #indyref @christainwright yea i've been accosted by some yes campaigners too #indyref @ray_mcrobbie we will use the peso (spain had some going cheap); he's 'that guy'; to be heralded by the second coming of jesus. #indyref @yeskippen yes indeed, i shall hope for no. #indyref @mylusciouslife @queen_uk good ol queen bess 2, we won't boot you out, you're always our bonnie lass. @johnnor hmm boris to save no campaign, not sure that's much of an improvement on brown. #indyref  i like good reasons, beats rhetoric. @johnnor good ol boris, a unique character. #indyref @bonniescotland3 that alone is almost tipping me to yes.  if not for everything else that makes me vote no. @mylusciouslife no the crown is separate. independence != rupublic. #indyref @dair_allan i'm sure a number of eu countries were in the iraq war, i shall check.  also what wealth would that be? @davythelotion @tom_watson true, mps and msps should get public sector pay. @dair_allan actually it says: when you tell people what to read, they vote yes. when you let them choose themselves they vote no. #indyref @dair_allan the un's in new york, the eu in brussels, but westminster is an issue, why? @dair_allan london, why do i keep hearing that name, which country is that in again? #indyref @dair_allan sadly i think it's not about me or you, but those who come after.  #indyref @allthejam someone exhume churchill, we're dying out here. #indyref @cuphook108 funny, i thought that too. @dair_allan only a #voteyes hypocrite would accuse someone of racism, whilst supporting an anti-english platform. @dair_allan well then, i'm definitely going down with the ship. @dair_allan suppose it's not actually a lifeboat, but a great white shark. @tns_uk yea,but you screw up on the turnout, so not credible. @buzzjunkie29 @craigmurrayorg we need a border convention, get it settled once and for all. @osianlewis you're going to have another country governing you either way.  either in europe, or in britain. @srb2245 lol, no sadly.  would be nice to be related though. @scottcrussell this is actually true.  i know some people who are voting yes just "to see what happens" my generation, smh. @srb2245 no money for you then. @martinh8900 @kevinjpringle countries are interdependent, particularly ireland. @54beats44 ooh, independent counties great idea.  watch all the talk of self-determination and democracy disappear. #indyref @martinh8900 @kevinjpringle over half ireland's trade comes from europe and a big chunk of that from the uk, it's hardly alone. rt @alicejrhowarth: "if scots think it is a good idea to be a country without a currency they have been badly misled". http://t.co/nzzz2mvi… @kevinjpringle i'll put my faith in countries working together.  that achieves more than one alone. #indyref @tonyholsters have a 'beef' lasagne, meantime. @cammyk_67 i cancelled anyway, couldn't afford it. rt @neoconhitman: yes campaign looks more like a stroppy teenager wanting to leave home but still wants his parents to pay the rent. #indyr… @independent_sco yea, but the yes pies are plastic. @richardlucas3 arguments is a stretch, rhetoric maybe. @richardlucas3 you keep vandalising and stealing lawn signs. @imediadoctor i weep at my generation, i really do.  bunch of numpties. @mik61scot @hazelmaciver 'fair and equal local income tax' best spin for #polltax. @gabyhinsliff pick a fight on facebook. @scotlandclare aww that's nice. @jplongland good point. @screamingmasses but they're sooooo cute. @louisemensch at the very least.  we also want back the money they've lost. @screamingmasses ooh i would like to see that.  #secondcoming @scotlandclare less money for healthcare, less money for charities..it can get worse. @patrickspeople we don't govern ourselves.  we vote for people to govern us, that's called an election. @scotlandclare i don't know, if your company goes bust and you're laid off, you might notice that. @gdnscotland @yougov so the money goes, soon the jobs follow. @poorbelly denmark sits between 3 of the largest economies in europe and scandinavia.  scotland is on the edge of an island in the sea, next @macnessie guess again. salmond loves the queen.  if you think voting yes will make scotland a republic, think again. #indyref @annebegg could just paint the outside of the house, purple is lovely this time of year. @pace04 i bet they'll still be backed by bank of england notes too, ooh the irony. a cloudy but sunny day. stormy night, i like it. @easy_neil try again.  it's a little generic. you know they all come from the same country, guess which one. @arobertwebb screw the border patrol, i would send tanks, lots of tanks. you cannot disinvent nuclear weapons any more than you can disinvent money or the internet.  that's reality. #justvoteno #indyref answer 3 tiny questions: where do jobs come from?

going to play as a stealth character in skyrim, haven't played a game properly in a month. @alispagnola lol, great question.  soap is meant to lift dirt, so the scum contains lots of it.  it's also the perfect habitat for mould. looking forward to setting up my own new studio.  unit hunting as we speak. sure it's nice to be paid, but when that fee takes away funds to do other things it's counter-productive. in other news, cineplex studios are doing really well, setting up a new facility.  worked with them for free for 6 years, happy to help. thanks to @btcare for repairing our local exchange today, following a thunderstorm last week.  phones and internet back online. i am so excited for them, it has been ten years in the making.  and i was very honoured to be asked to score a couple of cutscenes for them. dungeons: eye of draconus should be released on  steam, desura, itch.io, indie game stand,india gala, indie royale, humble store, ndie stars i'm going to miss my broadwood piano.  built sometime around 1884, its tone is beautiful, powerful yet delicate. @davidcorndc ooh cool. happy 4th of july! here's a blast from the past.  i wrote this back in 08.  it's lavolta. https://t.co/wnus9ttfwf sunset tonight, enjoy. http://t.co/qodmexpjqf sunshine and showers earlier, i was out with the camera, enjoy. http://t.co/fdmmfdv0hs rip rik mayall, he was an incredibly gifted and talented actor. after 7 years and 16 titles it's great for that to finally happen. dungeons: eye of draconus will be the first title i've scored to be released on steam, really looking forward to that. thanks to those who voted, it was greenlit yesterday. something fun to greenlight on steam, go vote http://t.co/6tdhyw7pqt rt @ss_santorelli: #ff @lakefilms @rpharaon @patrickgreen29 @filmscorematt @wendyshepherd @kentindiefilm @indywoodfilms @caspervandien @tif… i think effective scoring comes not from telling people what they should feel, but why they should feel it. https://t.co/m6tntknbk1 the completed track, enjoy. yes, yes i can.  as it turns out, half-hour episode scored in under half an hour. chosen ones rescore today.  let's see if i can do a half-hour episode in under an hour. for your sunday listening pleasure: rise of flight soundtrack https://t.co/3ipcmgnneg how to help a friend coping with depression: be there, that's all you need to do. rt @ss_santorelli: #ff @lakefilms @rpharaon @patrickgreen29 @filmscorematt @wendyshepherd @kentindiefilm @indywoodfilms @caspervandien @tif… for those playing #gtav here's a flight over the city http://t.co/k7vcg3wvo3 http://t.co/wr2rdrdjs1 video on 'wings over flanders fields.'  https://t.co/dm7eiepk0r @williamshatner yea, not my thing. tipped a chair over and punched a small hole in the drywall, oops.  been one of those days. spoke too soon, babysitting nephew, oh joy. yay a day off, meant to get up 6 hours ago, to enjoy more of it, but i guess i needed to sleep. so sad about peaches geldof, gone too young. boiled a pan dry yesterday.  actually charred the pasta (as well as the pan). lemon juice, scrubbing, and an hour later, bare metal. @huffingtonpost z-2, but with a luminescent nasa logo on the front instead. back to work, there's a pile of stuff building up. @kirstiemallsopp @sofie_allsopp yes indeed, we used to bring her flowers on mothers day, now we'll bring them to her grave. it's official, i'm back among the living. don't wannabe, just be. in a slight clerical error, the bank has declared me dead, oh joy. i loved south park: the stick of truth, beautiful music with angelic choir, particularly at the end. itching to write something, brain is creating again. funeral was good, and so mum.  i am having a quiet week this week, then resuming a normal schedule next week. mom sadly passed, following a 6 year battle with cancer. my heart goes out to those who have battled themselves or have a loved one with it. @eastcoastmp3 absolutely, there's so much more to music than writing and producing it.  getting it to your friends, clients and contacts etc my 'bleeding fingers concerto' for the competition.  enjoy. https://t.co/3ten9x2izb some of the battle tracks from ios fantasy combat game "noble", due out later this year. https://t.co/do0i2r0urd @sifinley hi simon, i love your work, you go for it. my assassin's creed fan trailer.  http://t.co/6atcesbvmx people questioning if elton john, has talent.  seriously? what's wrong with my generation.  of course he has talent, and lots of it. yes, i have finally joined the phenomena known as reddit.  expect frankness and a lot of bile, i've been in the industry for 10 years. @broadcastbeat thanks for following me. i can't stand naysayers.  'it's too ambitious, you won't achieve anything, i can't do it so how can you.' so unprofessional. https://t.co/lyelhlok8h dnd on a friday night, is there anything better. liet motif written in sections is by far the most powerful and useful technique, as it controls, immerses and emotes at the same time. layering is not the be all and end all of music composition.  it is what you teach plebs who know nothing about it and who have no talent. making some new contacts, i love networking. @buckhollywood eat something more filling or heavier.  too many light meals can encourage unhealthy snacking and binges. @xeroxcorp well you go for it, i'll gladly support a gutsy company. @xeroxcorp so many companies are no longer creative or innovative, they stagnate and drag product quality down.  it's great to have energy. i've helped films win festivals, web series get funding and broadcast on major networks, and games beat their better-funded rivals. for reference, i have scored 99.9% of productions i've worked on over the last 10 years, for free. "we didn't think we could afford you" is the most annoying excuse i've ever had for not being asked to score something. rise of flight, soundtrack playlist https://t.co/qgxzeyrqgu rise of flight, title theme https://t.co/4pv9ce2ljc lovely, the back wall is leaking again.  note to ppl building extensions, add a lip to any exterior frame, so water can run off. there we go, much better. rt @ss_santorelli: #ff @lakefilms @patrickgreen29 @filmscorematt @wendyshepherd @kentindiefilm @indywoodfilms @caspervandien @tiffpulv @gin… in a world that believes in free music, i am homeless and jobless. they're giving my mom 5 weeks to live, so much to do, so little time to do it. with so many developers looking for sound and music, i'm going to let you in on a big secret: nobody in the industry can do both. new world for skyrim http://t.co/mspnkx3w4j new world in skyrim http://t.co/fpjsfhsxki i'm working on a new world for skyrim.  here are a couple of screenshots. http://t.co/wbdzw8ig1l
