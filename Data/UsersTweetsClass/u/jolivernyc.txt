#nyrplayoffs i never like pulling the goalie that early @_americanthighs i just wanna hear  pierre talk about "head contact" no goals on a 5 on 3, moore takes a bad penalty...hard to see us pulling this out #nyrplayoffs no donovan in the line-up for the #usmnt?! @thebroadwayhat 3 on 3 with the tiny goals mike milbury is as disgusted by embellishment as islanders fans are disgusted by mike milbury ok, seriously @nhlonnbcsports, how bad is olczyk's gambling problem? this is ridiculous. my feels are driving me nuts #nyrplayoffs best. goalie change. ever. #nyrplayoffs plekanec clearly was throwing his head back to keep his hair out of his eyes. bad call #nyrplayoffs @nathenmcvittie 5-nil, if only for albert's chip. you'll never see a bit of skill like that from a mls plyer, never mind a centerback derek stepan. he's tough. he's a hockey player. #nyrplayoffs #celebratestanley http://t.co/iut36qvgyx holy moly look at duguay's blazer tonight #nyrplayoffs rt @nufcthreatlevel: rt @nufc breaking: #nufc manager alan pardew has issued the following fashion statement: http://t.co/si8etuigxm what is his status for the world cup?!?!?! has he been ruled out?!?! rt @politico george w. bush has knee surgery http://t.co/yoklh9on46 congrats to @willbredderman on the new gig. good get for the @newyorkobserver hits him in the freaking chest and goes in. unlucky crap i honestly didn't think that was gonna happen. that's gotta crush montreal #nyrplayoffs kreid or die it's not marty's night #nyrplayoffs pk subban just did his best steven gerrard #nyrplayoffs @nathenmcvittie i want him to have his post-game meal through a straw nice shot hags :) ...and now we're down 2 forwards a game misconduct for @carbombboom13?! refs a little sensitive (and blind) tonight attaboy @twigy15 what is gionta gonna do to staal?

what an unlikely comeback munch is back!!! #svufinale @finallevel come on fin, help my boy amaro out! #svufinale why is there no hockey on tonight? schedule fail @nhl crazy crowded rush hour commute. 7 platform at grand central @fakemta http://t.co/sflvrl8phv @erickuo i doubt it. we've seen worse go unpunished in the playoffs @justinbrannan if this rangers team is the italian job crew, henrik lundqvist plays the michael caine/mark wahlberg role first, second and third star go to lundqvist. unreal performance, again. #nyrplayoffs benoit pouliot owes henrik a really large plate of post-game poutine #nyrplayoffs i think pulling is a bad move here. short-handed the rangers can shoot at the empty net from anywhere #nyrplayoffs pouliot has been a good pick up off the free agency scrap heap, but he takes a lot of dumb penalties #nyrplayoffs another stupid penalty from pouliot. that should be 4, if not 5 and the game. #nyrplayoffs nash has been pretty dominant tonight. another good shift #nyrplayoffs please don't leave subban that open again. what up @nhlonnbcsports! #celebratestanley #rangersplayofffever #nyrplayoffs http://t.co/matodz0ufd yeah, henrik lundqvist is really, really good #nyrplayoffs habs get a call, maybe this will shut the fans up you can always count on pouliot to take a stupid penalty when we've taken control of the game #nyrplayoffs marty is on fire if you're trying to get me to visit long island the last thing you wanna do is remind me billy joel is from there. he just sucks @whyalwayssebby only 10 of the 20 rangers dressed tonight are canadian. i may have failed grad level stats but i'm pretty sure 10/20 = 50% if rick nash saved all his goals for the last two rounds i'm okay with that #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever #nashty omg there are ghosts in the ice!!!! #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever upset tokarski is starting and i cant use my "too much budaj in the pants" jokes. #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever rt @billdeblasio: .@deniscoderre, i'll bet you a bag of bagels and a rangers jersey on a new york win. what says montreal? #rangerstown htt… rt @billdeblasio: .@deniscoderre, loser must declare the winner's city's bagels the best and fly the winner's flag over their city hall. de… am i the only one who thinks price being out for the series isn't a good thing? back-up goalies kill us and budaj is a good one #nyrplayoffs teemu doesn't deserve to go out like this #becauseitsthecup why? why?!?!?! rt @nufc_stats express: villa &amp; former tottenham striker darren bent has emerged as newcastle’s latest transfer target #nufc rt @skysportsnews: breaking news: manchester city will not appeal their ffp punishment @matsalgado if the lakers offered up their first round pick this year i'd bite their hand off. joe bruno...not guilty, still has great hair @that_guy_jesse he's just so handsome... anyone know of a place in nyc showing the conference playoff final on sunday? @toonarmynyc @ffactoryny @woodworkbk bylsma and shero out in pittsburgh #hiretorts #pens iginla on the phone to crosby right now, booking tee times for saturday cant get over how classy these bruins fans are someone please tell me how good chara's corsi is. he's past it. come on now chara #norrisfinalist hoping for a violent final 10min. whoever wins this game should be nice and beat up by the time the eastern finals start 21k watching at the centre bell in montreal. what a great hockey city. love that place dale weise, rangers reject #nyrplayoffs #becauseitsthecup rt @wankersfullkit: grab your tuba, we've got one #fullkitwanker http://t.co/rjke5rkbh2 rt @condescendtorts: lundqvist http://t.co/jttq3mqa80 @_americanthighs give in. i wish i could find the dude at the garden who was taunting hank after the nashville game, but instead i'll watch some postgame #nyrplayoffs it's not all bad @sidneycrosbyego...at least you can shave now that beard that makes you look like a high school sophomore first, second and third star go to hank? #nyrplayoffs @nathenmcvittie i cant breathe remember when people were giving lundqvist shit after he signed that contract extension? yeah, about that #nyrplayoffs wow. no words. just wow. #nyrplayoffs @_americanthighs just getting over one myself great stick from staal forcing an offside. #nyrplayoffs @_americanthighs #rangersplayofffever malkin for mcdonagh and 4 on 3...i'd take that swap if i were the pens #nyrplayoffs it hit the stray stick and hank trapped it between his body and arm. unreal #nyrplayoffs stop running our goalie! that was a bizarre 2 on 1 #nyrplayoffs saying that fluery doesn't look comfortable out there would be the understatement of the year #nyrplayoffs oh man marty hit the net!!! #nyrplayoffs no idea what that was, but we almost got really, really lucky #nyrplayoffs is echoing the pens' complaints to national tv audiences in pierre's job description? #nyrplayoffs this goddam power play!!!! #nyrplayoffs @nathenmcvittie no, only if the player is on a clear breakaway what are these fans booing? i don't know if i've ever seen a more obvious trip #nyrplayoffs shit thank you, thank you. i'm here all week! try the veal #nyrplayoffs that's the first thing rick nash has put in the net in a month!!!! #nyrplayoffs #jokes i spent the entire first period on the exercise bike. so much nervous energy to burn off. zero desire to hear pierre #nyrplayoffs love me a sexy give-and-go from the 4th line! #nyrplayoffs @thegoldston love timmy krul in goal though @thegoldston really tough group with chile &amp; spain. key players are the same as they were last time, but 4 years older. need to rebuild @thegoldston weakest dutch team i can remember (including the team that were knocked out by ireland in qualifying). wont make the 2nd round five hours until puck drop. i'm shaking at my desk, biting my finger nails, getting up to pace back and forth. #rangersplayofffever looks like that puck changed direction before it got to gibson. kid finally gets beat. rt @rangersreport: lundqvist squirts water: $5,000.

emery beats the crap out of a goalie who doesn't want to fight: $0.

nhl player safety… the bruins and their fans have done nothing but embarrass themselves this series. easiest team for neutrals to root against. you cant stop brandon prust on the power play, you can only hope to contain him is there a more despicable group of athletes than the boston bruins? what a bunch of goons nbc just showed a montage of pacioretty taking a half dozen hits to the head this series, but lundqvist gets fined $5k for squirting water i love how chara found vanek all alone with an empty net right on the doorstep #norriswinner @gothamistdan rio and puyol don't have much left in the tank. cole hasn't had major injury problems and would be a major coup for mls wont be a distraction. not like they have important matches coming up rt @espnfc diego costa has told @athleticomadrid players he's leaving eddie johnson. lolz @lavanglish #sholadoesnt know marty st louis struggling to keep it together in the post game interview. i wonder what dom moore and crosbaby are talking about #nyrplayoffs that's why he's the king of new york #nyrplayoffs no power play time for rick nash how about we don't give up a short handed chance this time guys? #nyrplayoffs i forgot jagr used to rock that jofa helmet i used to have. that's crosby's mo. act tough to a guy who is being restrained by the officials. as @bdubi17 famously said "he's such a little baby" the clint dempsey/stephen a smith oberto beef jerky commercial is amazing. mike milbury is a complete idiot, but i do like his tie this evening ugh. flukey goal. ruins a pretty perfect period. rick nash's best shift of the playoffs fluery being fluery. have the pens hit their playoff self-destruct button? swagelin! rangers are flying. garden crowd is into it! #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever bylsma asking the linesman why he didn't clear marty out of the crease #nyrplayoffs not a dry eye in the house. script was written. amazing. #winitformarty #nyrplayoffs garden crowd chanting "marty". best fans in sports. bar none @thegarden @nyrangers there don't need to be four officials on the ice #nyrplayoffs because what the pens need is more help from the referees #nyrplayoffs so many feels if marty scores tonight #rangersplayofffever #winitformarty it's go time! #lgr #rangersplayofffever #winitformarty #sholadoesnt like to admit it, but he's a massive taylor swift fan #swiftie rt @nathenmcvittie: #sholadoesnt put baby in the corner #sholadoesnt want it that way #sholadoesnt not score at the nou camp #sholadoesnt have dessert before tea #sholadoesnt have a good first touch, or pace, or the ability to finish @marktreyger718 @gothamist looked that that place just weeks ago as a potential wedding venue. thank g-d i didn't put down a deposit! how would jose describe that performance from phil dowd? shola &gt; zidane #nufc quite a way for shola to end his newcastle career super ball from shola there. he's ready for brazil @sholainbrazil #nufc come on newcastle! don't let this slip! #nufc #lfc howay @nbcsportssoccer...get the "goal of the week" icon up on the screen  #nufc #lfc golazo! #nufc ball wasn't stationary. easy call. #nufc #lfc "steve gerrard, gerrard / he slipped on his fucking arse / he gave it to demba ba / steve gerrard, gerrard" loving the optimism from #nufc supporters this morning. in pardew we trust. taylor at fullback, debuchy on the wing, sissoko as a #10. no remy or ben arfa in the 18. cant wait for the season to be done with! #nufc i just cant wait for this season to be over. it's been a miserable 5 months. #nufc i'm not going to comment on the starting 11. rt @nyrangers: "i know (my father) is proud, and i know my mom is proud right now"-martin st. louis  #nyrplayoffs 5-1. see ya sunday #nyrplayoffs i'm checking my bank balance as we speak rt @thebroadwayhat i will pay any amount of money to see zucc fight crosby zuccarello just challenged crosbaby to a fight!!! #teamzucc #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever malkin with a cheap shot...what else is new? #nyrplayoffs crosby being a cry baby...what else is new? #nyrplayoffs bobby moore would have been proud of that slide tackle from brian boyle #nyrplayoffs uh oh ugh. stupid penalty brassard. everyone in the building saw that #nyrplayoffs who are you people and what have you done with the rangers power play?! #nyrplayoffs no lollygagging! brasssssssssssard! #nyrplayoffs big time defensive play by mcdonagh there. signs of life! #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever chris kreider has more goals in 2 playoff games than rick nash does in 12 are the allergy meds making me loopy or did we just score a power play goal?!?!?!?! #rangersplayofffever oh great. a power play. wake me up in 2 min #nyrplayoffs how did that not go in? #nyrplayoffs i cant tell if it's allergies or #rangersplayofffever which is more narcissistic: giggs subbing himself into a match or giggs shagging his brother's wife? i don't wish injury on anyone, but it'd be brilliant if phil jones were out for the world cup @bkcolin @dccc what are the last 4 reasons? "he really pulls no punches"- @justinbrannan speaking about @geraldorivera #ny11 really hard hitting stuff from @geraldorivera here. #ny11 "this is not the first time i've had a lot on my plate" says michael grimm, who notes the number of all you can eat buffets in #ny11 michael grimm is talking about abuse of power. really? pittsburgh hardly broke a sweat after the second goal. #nyrplayoffs we'll probably get one here, just as a tease #nyrplayoffs pierre mcguire talking about soccer. end my life now!!! thanks to pierre mcguire i now know how many 3rd and 4th liners every tiny town in minnesota has produced #becauseitsthecup desperate times call for desperate measures. i'm breaking out the stadium series toque for the 3rd period #rangersplayofffever #nyrplayoffs remember that marian gaborik guy? what's he up to these days? #nyrplayoffs five periods. we haven't scored on marc andre fluery in five periods of hockey. #nyrplayoffs #pathetic nash/st louis/stepan have to get it going. this team is going no where if pouilot is our best forward. #nyrplayoffs demoralizing. that's the only word that i can think of #nyrplayoffs why stop the play? let it end and then go to the replay. this wont count and we'll have lost possession in their zone #nyrplayoffs dorsett and carcillo scratched for taking bad penalties. more offensive upside with fast and miller too #nyrplayoffs nash w/ richie and hags to see if that gets him going. #nyrplayoffs diaz being in 100% the power play. i think moore has been pretty good. #nyrplayoffs cinco de #rangersplayofffever since gerrard's speech on the pitch liverpool have dropped 4 points from a possible 9. city have dropped 2 of 12. rangers looked shot out there. no energy in the 2nd half of the game. tough to see how we rebound in less than 24 hours #nyrplayoffs the second bonehead penalty dorsett has taken in the playoffs. looked to me like neal pulled back girardi beforehand...#nyrplayoffs this random red couch mcdonald's commercial is just stupid. @jacobkornbluh no comment. i was going to give you a pass...i assumed you were still thinking about the #cd48 race from last year! @jacobkornbluh pretty sure you mean #ad45 hank keeping us in the game. we gotta find out legs #nyrplayoffs did that pick ever get to kunitz? agree with engblom re: mcdonagh. mac is still finding his game. apart from game 7 vs flyers he hasn't been himself @that_guy_jesse i like your chances @that_guy_jesse what is the line? eventually we're going to have to get one on the power play. right? #nyrplayoffs malkin with a dirty hit. shocking. &lt;sarcasm&gt; #nyrplayoffs that was slightly better. great, another power play. i guess i'll use the bathroom now #nyrplayoffs this powerplay is painful to watch. completely devoid of any ideas or creativity #nyrplayoffs good to see someone other than pouliot get called for that #nyrplayoffs let's 
go
rangers 
!!!
#nyrplayoffs in pouliot we trust #lgr #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever game 2 nerves. we got this #lgr #nyrplayoffs #rangersplayofffever poor performance and a terrible game to watch, but the result is all that matters. gotta win games like this #rbny i've just seen ronaldo's goal. absolutely ridiculous https://t.co/zrzkk9vda4 peguy has changed the game here. #dare2bwp not good when you're playing up a man and the keeper is your motm #rbny robles. huge. #rbny so obvious. what a bonehead play from cahill. how much longer can we go on without seeing peguy? need someone to unlock this defense #rbny garnett walks off the court without shaking anyones hand. i feel like the nets game has been in the last minute for the past half hour. this is why i don't really like basketball remember that time kimura hit a decent cross? me neither #rbny dax got a little lucky there shoula let miller have it #rbny good ball from miller and good run from alexander, who has to do better with the finish #rbny #dalvny not much of a foul from miller there. complete overreaction from perez. dallas trying to even it up #rbny #dalvny in this heat, with the injuries they have at the back you've got to take advantage of the extra man. keep the ball. #rbny #dalvny reckless and stupid from watson. easy red card. don't know what shep is going on about #rbny #dalvny was there some sort of #giggsout protest today? old trafford was empty long before the full time whistle is it required that commentators bring up the 4-4 draw with arsenal whenever tiote shoots horribly wide? happens every match #nufc we've now hit both posts and the crossbar. #nufc @toonarmymia more likely a request for a contract extension rt @toonarmymia: new premier league rule; if shola ameobi scores against you, you're instantly relegated super shola finding his form just in time for the world cup #sholainbrazil shola!!!! #nufc if dummett gets anywhere near another free kick everyone should walk out of the ground #nufc the deciding factor was @pete5keet5keet picking up the bronx pale ale before ot started #nyr #rangersplayofffever http://t.co/fvkislxn5f does that mean we get a 4-2 win?

at the garden?! #nyr brassard centering zucc and msl. some serious beef on that line #nyr rosicky walks over to the @arsenal supporters and gives his shirt to a fan in a wheelchair. absolute class @toonarmynyc sir les stepping in to be the peace keeper too sorry, it was the less big frenchman. my bad #afcvstot tackle of the season from the big f'in german #afcvstot @sportscenter carl hagelin #sc3stars @bspitzer both! hope everyone has a fun/safe purim/st patrick's day weekend @masbiask @bspitzer @nycgreenfield looking good barry! @nyrangers how many regulation/ot wins does hank have? richter never had the benefit of the shootout ron asked who can spark the team...no mention of nash. has everyone given up on him playing like a superstar? #nyr hey rick nash: you're paid over $7mil a year and you're on the bench watching benoit poliot in the last min of the game. get angry!!! #nyr someone has to make parise pay the price for being in front on the 2nd. he was there all day. #nyr unlucky bounce for nash, but he's gotta be harder on the puck for minny's 1st. #nyr if brassard and pouliot are two of our top 4 forwards, we're going nowhere. #nyr that isn't necessarily me being critical of av. he hasn't played well enough to earn those minutes. #nyr @dfeuerstein he's gotta play well enough to be out there. the rangers best forwards have to be their best forwards. down a goal, last minute of the game, 6 skaters on the ice and none of them are named rick nash... #nyr the hynocerous returns!!! rt @adamschefter fb henry hynoski is returning to the giants on a 1-year, $1m deal. just want to point out that after i ate dinner yesterday i went out to get frozen yogurt wearing shorts and a hoodie. #tbt @nbcsvu tonight = wow can city get two in injury time to win? it's happened before... #ucl it's been a great game of football, but the officials have been shocking. #ucl fantastic finish from messi. it's been a compelling match tonight, but barcelona deserve to be in front #ucl don't know how the likes of xavi and iniesta will cope with a world class player in midfield like james milner. we'll see #ucl @jacobkornbluh something tells me that wont happen scary, heartbreaking scenes up in east harlem. cant wait for ralph krueger to get started at @southamptonfc. i think he's going to be really impressed with rickie lambert's slapshot lincoln wouldn't have done a tv interview w/ you prior to the super bowl, but i don't see you complaining about that http://t.co/ssrvvvfuko staal has not had a good game tonight against his bros. #nyr how on earth does mcdonagh get 2min for roughing? #nyr zuccarello with a takeaway in the neutral zone and the vision to find brass. i freakin love that little guy #nyr well that's a pretty lousy way to start a game #nyr @foxsoccer could you imagine javi martinez going up against brian mcbride? he'd spend the whole match on the floor! everyone tweeting about robben's diving, but i've never seen a centerback as soft as javi martinez. #ucl arsenal living dangerously here. bayern threatening to run riot. #ucl don't see centerbacks go down that easily too often. get up javi martinez #ucl rt @moyes_must_go: for people asking, yes i supporting arsenal tonight. 

like all bpl fans we all want other bpl teams to do well. #teambpl mueller and kroos on the bench. it's almost not fair #ucl frightening scene in dallas w rich peverley. kinda reminds me of the fabrice muamba incident. thoughts are w/ peverley's teammates &amp; family i. love. billy. zabka. billy zabka is killing it on tonight's episode of how i met your mother #himym rt @nufc: we've had the shirt signed by all #nufc players on twitter. simply rt and follow @nufc to be in with a chance! http://t.co/vbreor… @notthegymnast tough loss shannon. we'll keep the top of the east warm for you tonight. 5 minutes ago i got this text from @kinderbanks: "and why is chad barrett still a professional player?" yeah, he's off. great vision from deuce though. i didn't think he was off. @thevipersnest they should be dangerous on the break get stuck in sapong! need those fantasy points it disgusts me that anyone ever thought obafemi martins would be a suitable replacement for alan shearer demba on his hat trick. demba double oh ahh demba ba and it all comes undone for spurs... jan vertonghen. lolz the rangers need to take more penalties #nyr rt @passion_corner: this is the year we bring it to a whole new level #runwithus #rbny #youcantsitwithus @newyorkredbulls @vikingarmy_sc ht… rt @iwantcurlyhair2: dear @mls ... where do i apply to be a referee? "man, i really thought boyland was going to get off," - said no one, ever devastated. didn't believe it was real when i got the update on my phone. absolutely heart broken @espnfc shola ameobi #espnfc100days @nyrangers raising money to pay for the contract extension? where did brad richards think he was there? 4-1! can pardew get sent off every week?! #nufc rt @paddypower: alan pardew is reportedly waiting for david meyler in the hull city car-park with a handkerchief filled with snooker balls. lads have been brilliant since pardew was sent off #nufc pards phones down to the bench to ensure we make our ritual leftback swap #nufc love me some pardew mo-mo sissoko! @toonarmyamerica @papajohnsuk does this offer extend to the papa john's on greenpoint ave in sunnyside, queens? gracias figueroa respectfully disagree with the commentator. steve bruce's nose is always in front, regardless of the scoreline #nufc debuchy got bailed out by krul after committing a stupid foul in a dangerous area. repaid it by cutting back for sissoko to finish #nufc that was brilliant from timmy krul. can holland drop him every week? #nufc wow! #nufc yellow shirts. it's just like watching brasil  #nufc that glasses/scarf combo from magath is #stylish. watch out @special1tv rt @henrykraemer: guys, don't get an abortion, because you might regret it, just like this man. http://t.co/j1lkbhm5e0 girardi re-signed. it's all good. #nyr steve banks is a great choice to lead hra. smart, dedicated and an all-around good guy. michael sam would be a "distraction" in an nfl locker room, but riley cooper who casually drops the n-word gets a contract extension rt @skysportsnews: breaking: nicolas anelka has been banned for five matches over his 'quenelle' gesture and fined £80,000. what are the odds on callahan getting injured blocking a shot tonight, thus keeping him here past march 5th? #nyr sorry @mlb, i'm not going to sign a petition to make #openingday a holiday until election day is a federal holiday rt @webleedbluenyc: whatever happens at the trade deadline let us not forget who gave us 110% every shift for the past 8 seasons #captainca… @jacobkornbluh i just cant believe people still pay money to watch the knicks rt @egilostenstad: there was a time when things were so bad at l'pool they considered signing players like me. m united fast approaching th… if i get the number 9.9 &amp; "profit" on the back of my wonga sponsored shirt will ashley invite me into the directors box for a match? #nufc @bkcolin not sure comparing yourself to a virus is going to resonate with voters knicks fans would argue it should also be illegal for raymond felton to possess a basketball rough day. need a drink. scratch that. need another drink. in the goaltending match up of the tournament, each has given up a softie soft goal for hank to give up. @skyfootball all at home sweden dominating, but taking bad penalties. gonna need a big kill here breaking: chivas usa to change their name to the montreal expos #punoftheday rt @dndailypolitics republican #ny sen. greg ball harpooned over cribbed paragraphs in #whale bill rt @johnkerry: good luck to ma’s @schaus729 @kbells22 @carpy05 @mduggan10 @shellfish20/@bostoncwhl players/all #teamusa women’s hockey on m… price gets beat by a shot from the neutral zone. that is how this game ends. canadians are freaking out. come on latvia!!!!!!! rt @bglendenning: does anyone know which siberian gulag russia ice hockey team are due to 'warm down' in after defeat to finland? rt @steinersports: retweet to win a @rmcdonagh27 autographed #teamusa puck! #sochi2014 http://t.co/qiwwetvhfi @anthonyweiner hiller has been the outstanding men's player as well. swiss getting great goaltending all around. #askthierry which is a greater achievement: winning a world cup, or making johnny steele look a half decent player? #askthierry do you watch house of cards? #askthierry why would you try to convince xavi to come here when we already have dax mccarty? #askthierry did you think anyone could be worse at football than ray parlour before you met johnny steele? teemu just called crosbaby out for diving. have some respect sidney sorry @nbcsports and rebecca lowe, still don't understand the difference between pairs and ice dancing. #sochi2014 ryan mcdonagh is a great american. @thegoldston check out @woodworkbk in prospect heights glad i didn't hit the snooze button one more time. woulda missed some goals #teamusa #dawnsearlylight phil kessell. what. a. move. #teamusa #dawnsearlylight give it to kaner kaner hit pavelski's tape like it drives a cab in buffalo that's gotta be a broken hand for kesler. hope @derekstepan21 is ready for tomorrow! callahan nails ovie and mcdonagh strips malkin. our boys are bringing it this morning! #nyr #usahockey @obrienmurray @davelaska @davecatalfamo @jessicaproud @nickreisman @newyorkgop at least he paid attention during high school sex ed rt @tweetbenmax: .@jgoldny to @nyccfb (repeatedly): political consultants aren't very good. norway power play! your time to shine zucc that norway jersey...ufff. where can i get one with #36 zuccarello on the back?! loves the matching ties from the team usa coaching staff. makes up for the jerseys being hideous. rt @usahockey: men's team lines are posted #dawnsearlylight http://t.co/h60ysbv1km loris has made two brilliant saves, krul has dropped two rebounds right in front of spurs players. the difference in the game #nufc again, krul has to do better. brilliant ball from sammy. 6'7 pele #nufc @lavanglish you could easily blame debuchy, sissoko, santon, krul and sammy for that. too easy. santon giving the ball away too easily there. might as well have ben arfa playing right back #nufc we're causing a bit of trouble for them on set pieces @lavanglish @nufc_us we're lucky they haven't got townsend or lennon on tonight. a proper winger would tare him apart. so unlucky for cisse! @nathenmcvittie i'd have babayaro back at this point. shocking. forget santon being the next maldini, he looks more like the next peter ramage #nufc shocking. absolutely shocking from santon. really poor from santon. it's about time he gets dropped #nufc west brom deserved that. poetic justice would be the baggies getting a dubious late pen to win it #wba #cfc pretty sure nbc sent bob costas over to sochi to die finally caved and allowed myself to get hooked on house of cards #bingewatching games gone soft. that's not even a foul, never mind a booking #nufc ship marveaux out, he's useless @iwantcurlyhair2 lack of options, who else do you put there? rt @iwantcurlyhair2: #limbotim what did people honestly expect from this match? look at the opposition, look at our injury list. never going to get a result here #nufc ben arfa losing the ball has lead directly to two chances for chelski. sammy ameobi looks like a 6'7 pele #nufc santon picking out de jong with that ball reminded me of pirlo there. tactical masterstroke from pardew #nufc nice hug between pardew and mourinho. #bromance #nufcvcfc trap game. who didn't see this coming? #nyr did tanner glass win a "be sidney crosby's linemate for a night" phone-in contest? rangers get some help from the islanders there. which was more one sided: the rangers/avalanche game or the evolution/creationism debate? bill nye and ryan callahan were both dominant i've finally caved and putt timber on my workout mix. love of ke$ha &gt; hatred of pitbull. rangers on a roll at the moment, so of course now would be a great time for sather to trade the captain #nyr callahan looks like a man possessed this period. fantastic reaction to the shenanigans sather put him through this week #nyr #captaincally callahan scores! give the man a contract! #captaincally honey glazed almonds with cranberries and sea salt...such a legit midday snack! love the video for midnight memories. when one direction leave a party they go and get kebabs. they really are just like us. going through the incognito/martin text messages. i'd love to see james earl jones &amp; malcolm mcdowell read these like the sprint commercials way to completely choke there @nhldevils. enjoyable way for me to end my evening. cheers. don't get too excited newcastle supporters. jfk thought he was telling ashley he'd like to resign, not resign. #nufc that was a lovely, lovely move from city rt @moyes_must_go: come on you blues!
