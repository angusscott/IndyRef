they're more moral.. forgive me for being angry @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 that the racism, sexism and general nastiness to outsiders is tolerated &amp; even encouraged even by some young ppl @mrtickle3  i suppose i'm quite happy to criticise my own &amp; that's the difference. i find much intolerance tolerated amongst my community @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 of course and i know it's real too, my friends (muslim) have suffered precisely bc of that. @mrtickle3 you know what is true? i'm seen as the outsider, the kufr, so i'm simply responding to the existing dynamic when speaking to some @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 leaving aside the legality, my point is that we shouldn't automatically be tolerant of things that hurt others. @mrtickle3 of course. i dislike nasty behaviour though &amp; superiority complexes...we are either right or wrong in a discussion, not de facto @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 of course but we live together. if my religion said eating babies were ok, i hope you won't leave me to it @mrtickle3 additionally for me, those who can be good, who can see and implement justice without needing to read how to first, are special. @mrtickle3 social welfare, education, science, requires tolerance, freedoms, good economies-can't just be implemented top down w/some rules @mrtickle3 i think i heard hamza yusuf say this in a speech. it's so true. those great things about the caliphates didn't happen in a vacuum @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 i don't tell you how to follow your faith, but knowing what is/isn't permissible in faith isn't only your space @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 i did follow it for a long time &amp; still spend time reading islamic history. it's fascinating stuff, not a lecture @mrtickle3 he even used to lower his gaze- quite amusing. he of course didn't know it. but he embodied all the great islamic traditions @mrtickle3 most muslim man i've ever known, (w/o prayer) was an atheist. so generous, respectful of women, great to his mum, principled @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 apparently i'm after all this love from the ummah. so perhaps i shouldn't as i may just come across as easy. @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 i always forget that too.. you young things. @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 it's the kind of thing that was even more ironic as she's using a watermarked picture of a beautiful girl @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 completely agreed. but self reflection comes after having general respect for others, even if we disagree @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 she was advising on using fair and lovely, about never getting a man. it was stupid but just nasty stuff. @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 perhaps. but everything i've ever learnt about good aspects of islam rarely obvious on the tls of such people @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 the superiority complex that the other lady demonstrated- as well as vanity- seemed quite petty really. @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 call me presumptuous to hold those who claim to be moral &amp;better guided to a higher standard than those who don't @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 it doesn't excuse their behaviour though i find attitude nasty. but figured theists with morals should do better @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 wasn't impressed by the atheists higher up tl either but they can't be angry for no reason as i mentioned yday @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 just bc the hindu nationalists/ edl are racist does that mean muslims ought to be racist in turn? of course not @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 yes - this is whataboutery that i also dislike. bad behaviour from muslims not excused by bad behaviour by others @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 well by definition i mean the presumptions held by the tl i joined that we ought to just stop thinking of islam @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 that bc we have left our faith should leave our families (muslim) friends (muslim) and never think of islam again @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 don't i know it :) there seems to be a group who think ex muslims hang around other muslims for fun @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 yeah it isn't. it's only twitter seems a tad harsh to begin questioning each other's sexuality on here. @mrtickle3 tbh i really shouldn't have bothered. but found it odd commenting on other peoples appearance while hiding behind a fake pic @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 whereas your friend i notice favourites and retweets even the most banal things that is said against atheists. @carefulsoul786 @mrtickle3 i agree with him. i don't agree with everything he says. that's the big difference. @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 well i don't define the groups. they've defined themselves. and as i'm an ex muslim, they've also defined me. @mrtickle3 @semzyxx @carefulsoul786 thanks. i'm not. but i find this attitude so common, that ad hominem is perfectly fine bc i'm not muslim @semzyxx @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786 i never added you. your friend did. and for people who claim to be moral, never heard so many insults. @llewelyn_morgan not at all. always great to talk.. better to be reminded of what's good, right, and mad. @llewelyn_morgan well they want freedom with a capital f. naive to think change of structure gives them the benefits w/o none of the loss @mrtickle3 @carefulsoul786  it's the classic mentality of my group is always right, your group must be in the wrong, somehow, somewhere @carefulsoul786 @semzyxx yet to ever see you agree that maybe some muslims may occasionally bad things. it's always someone else to blame @llewelyn_morgan wasn't a big fan of the lack of engagement &amp; simultaneous hard nosed approach. this was our union to lose. @carefulsoul786 @semzyxx i'm not commenting on your appearance as your good friend kindly does, like an asian little colourist that she is @carefulsoul786 @semzyxx it's hardly discourteous to agree that you are just someone who agrees with your group &amp;

key correlation is suffering. @carefulsoul786 the answer is of course it depends on the extent of suffering and level of violence. i don't believe vitriol is innate. @carefulsoul786 what point do victims of violence/animosity stop thinking about what their aggressors claimed was the root justification @carefulsoul786 @semzyxx you're not silly or irrational to continue to be angry at the things that they did which were wrong, cruel &amp; unjust @carefulsoul786 @semzyxx u could leave the country &amp; still feel bitter at  injustice &amp; cruelty of orgs &amp; people who consider themselves good @carefulsoul786 @semzyxx arent u angry at govt for forcing u to pay taxes contribute towards things u consider wrong-eg killing kids?

not for beliefs, but bc u &amp; your family hungry, scared, hurt. @harvirdhillon as long as rule of law, balance of power, education &amp; wealth gain funding future investment-will always have peaceful states @harvirdhillon so scientific funding enables economic growth (internet,telcomms) all improve prosperity of ppl so christian brutality curbed @harvirdhillon so you can have a country like the usa where majority don't value science, but institutional set up means science is funded @harvirdhillon what matters aren't beliefs of the people, but institutional set up, balance of power, the lack of extractive institutions @harvirdhillon that's true to a certain extent. but it doesn't explain why islamic science, medicine, jurisprudence was so successful @harvirdhillon i'm not. but i think most people would behave brutally if given chance &amp; so if law and order broke down, ppl would be 'evil' @harvirdhillon just bc someone says they're fighting for jihad doesn't mean that's what led them there. wahabbism spread by ppl not god. @harvirdhillon despite the lack of jurisdiction being one of the key enablers for injustice to occur, world over. @harvirdhillon what most people believe anywhere is highly worrying. majority of west pro capital punishment. ppl would strip citizenship @harvirdhillon if muslim populations of the world had access to as much wealth &amp; power as christians, they wouldn't be fighting for justice @harvirdhillon only reason christians don't follow them is bc they have wealth (so choice) &amp; strong institutions that protect their freedom @harvirdhillon the bible is just as brutal- the crusades, holocaust, and atlantic slave trade all justified using the bible. @harvirdhillon me ruled by tyrants for so long,w/west as co conspirators. rejection of west natural &amp; adoption of brutality aligns w/history @harvirdhillon we see in our books (and the holy books) whatever we choose to, in order to achieve whatever we want to achieve. @harvirdhillon of course it does, just like russian aggression and american imperialism. the religious aspect emphasised by the political @harvirdhillon he was a victim of confirmation bias. he didn't criticise his own beliefs as well as he criticised everyone else's. despite the gung-ho neo-con phase hitchens was by far the best atheist orator and writer and the most frank, beautifully unapologetic @harvirdhillon sure but his anti islam stance is naive when adherents of all religions are lined up throughout history. @harvirdhillon he grew up in a culture where mysticism and eastern spirituality is cool.. not much of a rationalist or skeptic tbh i'm so disappointed. hitchens was pro iraq war. dawkins has gone crazy. s harris has gone buddhist. and dennett just had a beard anyway. rt @iram_ramzan: oh let's all blame the mosques,  i doubt many of those groomers even went to the mosque #bbcsml rt @josungkim: like father, like sons: brian mcknight &amp; sons singing the national anthem http://t.co/ty85cql9eg rt @afp: #breaking: israel plans to expropriate 400 hectares of west bank: military rt @johnmcternan: rt@lseeuroppblog: nordic countries not as similar or as 'exceptional' as conventional wisdom would suggest http://t.co/cj… rt @holland_tom: it's a cause of shame that anyone in the uk should feel afraid to make his or her political views known: http://t.co/atuce… rt @peterrneumann: haha "@davidwearing: yes campaign to play trump card http://t.co/74umjyvdcn #indyref" rt @sharifkouddous: for rampant human rights abuses, gender apartheid &amp; spreading wahhabism - egypt grants saudi king honorary doctorate

harm caused @mrtickle3  i don't believe in good or evil. we contribute to the same amount of harm (by #s) continuing with system of economic inequality @mrtickle3 95+% of all violence perpetrated by men. if there ever was a safe group of people to categorise based on stats, it's men :) @mrtickle3 stand by my argument. it wasn't a conspiracy. there were too many foibles at work rather than the evil required for conspiracy @mrtickle3 because i'm beating you up. who else does things like that other than the immoral (and mostly men).. @mrtickle3 this is my issue with conspiracy..always a bunch of people being slaves to their bias, their pride, greed. intention is so flimsy @mrtickle3 dude. don't make me beat you up.  cos that's what i do to teenagers bc i don't believe in anything bc i don't believe in god. @mrtickle3 you are old enough to realise that a lot of misguided idiots aren't always lying, they genuinely want to believe silly evidence. @mrtickle3 he saw in the flimsy military intelligence what he wanted to see. it's a trait common to both good and bad people. @mrtickle3 beauty of confirmation bias comes here: we accept flimsy evidence supporting our aims,at expense of strong evidence that counters @mrtickle3 yes but that group were quite transparent with their aim to go to war. that's my problem. they didn't hide that they wanted to. @mrtickle3 personally it requires those able to oppose/challenge also conspiring to achieve the same, while presenting falsity to public @mrtickle3 with that definition every single determined group in the world is a conspiracy @mrtickle3 alright so we are agreed really. though to go back we were talking about conspiracy of the iraq war rather than gross negligence @mrtickle3 was a critique of tb, that he behaved presidentially-using cabinet powers to further his own goals - keeping cabinet in the dark @mrtickle3 maybe difference between us -i think there were ppl in power who didn't agree who could've stopped him &amp;didn't bc of incompetence @mrtickle3 i wouldn't call blair negligent. it's not negligence when you misuse powers and information, that's wilful illegality. @mrtickle3 i never said blair didn't intend to go to war. we were discussing the mechanisms that should have stopped him &amp; why they failed @mrtickle3 negligence. but unless that person in charge removed them to kill the victim it's not conspiracy. @sunnybluesky321 @mrtickle3 not that i would describe myself as a patriotic brit, (was referring to the ukipers) but i do love my home.. @mrtickle3 and those systems failed bc of human traits and human susceptibility to pride, envy, sloth, not bc of conspiracy. @sunnybluesky321 @mrtickle3 no insult intended :) he shouldn't spend too much time talking to us lest he be corrupted. @mrtickle3 empiricism is so much more than evidence existing for a theory. i don't want to discuss epistemology as i will just get angry @mrtickle3 gosh. it's taught in business schools. must make it correct like the laffer curve, like trickle down economics. oh my. @mrtickle3 this is why i hate sociology. people just make up theories based on hindsight and selective evidence. it's not how theory works @mrtickle3 now you've jumped into madness again just like you supporting your boss doesn't mean plotting to achieve ultimate business goals @mrtickle3 honestly try daniel kahneman and stephen pinker. this stuff has moved on since orwell... @mrtickle3 confirmation bias is a more sophisticated form, better than group think, as it describes how ppl respond to new information. @mrtickle3 if group think existed by now you would be an atheist patriotic brit given the groups you hang out with on twitter. @mrtickle3 they didn't plot... to plot is to have agreed goals and motivations. they were incompetent together rather than working together @mrtickle3 i guess i've never heard if gross negligence being described as conspiracy. that's what made no sense to me. @mrtickle3 i don't think of that as conspiracy but more a combination of ppl eager to achieve their bosses aims,to ppl being lazy and stupid @mrtickle3 again..work on enough projects &amp; you'll agree it's bad 'normal' practice for ppl who have too much to achieve in too little time @mrtickle3 so the conspiracy to increase risk by bypassing (yet to be specified) procedure when making political judgements (law?/policy?) @mrtickle3 never said he did. but do you see how many things can culminate into appearing like a conspiracy. when it's just how humans work @mrtickle3 along with facts like cabinet weren't informed. idealistic types heady from success in bosnia. angry types from iraq war 1 @mrtickle3 i have actually read it. who hasn't ?. but it's quite clear that many people disagreed, many attempts to stop tb. @mrtickle3 by incompetence i mean a bunch of rubbish people, doing rubbish things. conspiracy implies all worked and motivated by same goal @mrtickle3 that's my view that it came down to a bunch of gits who weren't necessarily pro war, but really wanted to not be seen as idiots. @mrtickle3 we forget human incompetence comes down to those evils of greed, sloth, envy and pride. people worked hard to save their skin @mrtickle3 have you ever worked with someone who's been embarrassed into sticking by their bad decisions to prove their competence? @mrtickle3 i'm not saying it's a mistake though either. when they failed, demonstrated clear incompetence in managing their responsibility @mrtickle3 not to say abuse of power isn't common. but yet to meet a group of people who are capable of pulling strings quietly&amp;effectively @mrtickle3 still surprised that someone who works close to govt thinks that elites are capable of conspiracy. you're a hopeful soul :) @mrtickle3 i've never said gross negligence. you've mentioned it a few times now. never claimed it. it's like you talk to yourself sometimes @mrtickle3 be specific here, what key mechanism bypassed by conspiracy (other than question of legality) led to the iraq war? @mrtickle3 in fact no i say that it failed, you say that it was a conspiracy marshalled by the men in power to achieve their aims. @mrtickle3 those are the procedures you refer to ie responsibility to examine and ensure policy is legal was the process you decry as failed @mrtickle3 i'm not saying that. not conflating them. do you actually read what we type :) @mrtickle3 that's not quite the same thing as a conspiracy of people working to further tb's aim-attorney general knew abt illegality of war @mrtickle3 people are charged with the responsibility of ensuring prime ministers don't break laws didn't do their job, not held accountable @mrtickle3 everything fails or succeeds because of the people. always irked me that allah gets the credit for our wins, never our losses. @mrtickle3 you claimed it was a conspiracy. and i'm saying that having worked in govt, it's pretty hard to even attempt a small conspiracy. @mrtickle3 i also work on large intntl projects and it never ceases to amaze me how even the well intentioned get it spectacularly wrong @mrtickle3 i've not once said it was negligence, for ref most people are incompetent in that they don't achieve what they say they will @mrtickle3 so you appreciate how hard it is to implement any plan in a small crowd with strong views, even if they usually support you @mrtickle3 i think you're missing the point.. it's all these little details about how humans work that culminate into massive f ups. @abdullaandalusi and ps inequality is both disgusting and rampant in many countries which are neither secular or liberal. @abdullaandalusi secular liberalism also led to the socialism ie how you and your family manages to get free healthcare in the uk :) rt @elizabday: matthew parris in @thetimes today coins my new favourite insult: "the stupid person's thinking person." @saifrrahman @drusamahasan don't forget the mohammedan theory of evolution. still jerks the eye when i read that phrase in books from 19thc @osmanarsenal41 well it reminded me of how fearless isis are and why- they're armed up to the hilt and think they will get to heaven. reminding us about russia's strategy for europe and the uk's response:

"beware of false knowledge, it is more dangerous than ignorance". @mrtickle3 it's common amongst extremists of all colours to be mechanistic in their views- thinks the world is fixable- applies wrong fix @mrtickle3 ha. god. what a nasty group. full of engineers and math teachers. the mechanistic simple view of the world really suits them. @mrtickle3 if the rest of the women who sat next to me could nod and not feel any outrage at what was being said and me as a 15 yr old could @mrtickle3 hizb ut tahrir are a disgusting group really. their meetings even a decade ago are a stain on the muslim communities who attend @mrtickle3 the women's meeting also recounted a rape attack on a woman raped by her brother- and then blamed the woman for being at the club @mrtickle3 i actually went to hizb it tahrir talks myself. they described westerners as looking like pigs cos they ate pigs @mrtickle3 no dignity really when we are not consistent. i hope you are as vociferous against any isis supporting members of our democracy @mrtickle3 i think you wouldn't start a petition against someone who didn't think isis committed blasphemy&amp; u wouldn't get 22k votes for it @mrtickle3 totally but those who would ban the cartoons are usually not very pro democracy either. in fact pro totalitarian usually. @mrtickle3 a petition agreed by 22k, most likely muslims - as no one cares about these mp appointments usually. http://t.co/rpitqkyfhq @mrtickle3 but didn't you support a petition against maajid nawaz to stop him becoming an mp cos he said he doesn't think it's blasphemy @mrtickle3 ok i concede. you are right.  no mass protests at blasphemy. just general disgust. which does not mass protest make. @mrtickle3 maybe you weren't around in the uk then but couldn't get through a single day on fb or twitter w/o muslim disgust at cartoons @mrtickle3 http://t.co/15xhiqnuin

go to reactions in britain- protests. 
danish cartoons - http://t.co/3g7onjpg0p @mrtickle3 can't believe you even accused me of such rubbish. but sure. thanks. cheerio. @mrtickle3 yeah but it's that fringe that go out and protest when non muslims blaspheme and the majority of brits go with it @mrtickle3 so that's how you think you win arguments. by missing much of current affairs, by digressing, then building straw men. @mrtickle3 or they will just claim isis are jewish and so their crimes are those by non muslims. ultimate denial it's to the end. @mrtickle3 sure- try listing destruction of prophets w/o saying they're isis &amp;most would call them blasphemers - but not if u say isis 1st @mrtickle3 i wouldn't other them but they do other everyone else. nobody frames 'west' as the other more in any community i've come across @mrtickle3 hope you spread the word though re rushdie and fatwa. khomeini was a character in rushdie's book, a coward living in plush exile. @mrtickle3 ask any random brit muslim you come across whether shias are actual muslims or not. surprisingly number don't think so. @mrtickle3 it didn't actually. i have so much respect for shia muslims. they make us from sunni backgrounds look weak and unprincipled. @mrtickle3 i mean brit muslims not in muslim countries&amp; not even all of them, but the shouting hypocrites who always protest abt non muslims @mrtickle3 no courage or dignity amongst the protesting religious masses  who claim to love their religion but fail to defend it. @mrtickle3 i'm being slow for you. the same hypocrites who will protest fictional cartoons don't care if isis blow up their actual prophets @mrtickle3 digressing. so no protests if muslims destroy prophets and tombs. let's bet they will protest if the west accidentally does it @mrtickle3 a fb page/blog. those easy tools to demonstrate to the world we care and have a heart, that take minutes to make but seen by many @mrtickle3 social media makes it easy to show devotion to blasphemy against prophets &amp; couldn't even be bothered to make a superficial page @mrtickle3 yet isis actually dishonoured muslim prophets by blowing them up, and not even a single fb page to 'like' action against them @mrtickle3 ok as a refresher see http://t.co/vb3yfnq9ek 
let's use danish cartoons. couldn't move for the barrage of blasphemy charges @mrtickle3 positions from ignorance is amongst worst things we as people do, as we base our actions on what we know inc how to do good @mrtickle3 worse. most today haven't even read the book. don't even know why fatwa was placed (bc rushdie characterised khomeini in exile) @mrtickle3 they were huge reactions to perceived blasphemy by non muslims. still talking about rushdie today and his 'honours'. @mrtickle3 this isn't about isis and whether they represent brit muslims- they don't. it's about blasphemy and reaction to blasphemy. @mrtickle3 they tweet all their evidence. they show the world their crimes. they do it in the name of the books my family follows. i'm angry @mrtickle3 i think we will have to agree to disagree here. i thought you would be reasonable enough to accept that there's double standards @mrtickle3 let's stick to the uk. quite a few british muslims over there destroying holy sites, and qurans where's the cries of blasphemy? @mrtickle3 ffs people should have some dignity &amp; stop turning away from the crimes of the world. justice isn't only meted out to our enemies @mrtickle3 yeah but still. i mean even i didn't think they could be so much in denial to believe such farce after following isis for a year @mrtickle3 no one thought that reasonably when it came to danish cartoons. they went out and chanted burn danish flags, boycott danish goods @mrtickle3 totally hilarious that now baghdadi is a bad guy, he's somehow gone from muslim to jewish agent of mossad. like yeah. @mrtickle3 i just think the general narrative is everything muslims do must be kinda ok, everything non muslims do isn't,even with blasphemy @mrtickle3 today's population are even more sensitive to blasphemy- see danish cartoons here. i just think people are hypocrites really. @mrtickle3 they would be out on the streets screaming for the destruction of isis. some don't bc they prob agree with isis, others god knows @mrtickle3 consistency. if muslims really gave a shit about the destruction of holy sites and the burning of quran they'd protest isis now. @mrtickle3 but with blasphemy it doesn't matter what led to blasphemy,(rushdie &amp; schools?) the blasphemer is protested not their cause. @mrtickle3 if there was any outrage over the destruction of holy sites and burning of qurans, i would've commended for consistency, but nada @mrtickle3 ok clarified and agreed. blasphemy protests aren't about govt actions was my point that i badly made. @mrtickle3 "we are responsible for our own actions. not the actions of others" apply your own principles. @mrtickle3  it's a supreme irony that when isis are systematically destroying the graves, qurans, and holy sites, muslims here say nothing @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja think we are missing the point here, which is british muslims have protested for far less blasphemy in far larger #s @mrtickle3 agreed..so you agree that british embassies of the world weren't responsible for rushdies book &amp; no protests should've happened @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja protests are never usually at govt policy esp not for blasphemy. isis blasphemes and gets off scot free from muslims @vodkaninja perhaps :( @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja fact many countries banned rushdies books and that didn't stop the protests &amp;protests only happen if it's non muslims @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja foreign intervention is irrelevant here. if blasphemy only applies when non muslims do it, then it's silly. @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja when a soldier burnt a quran there were protests. when isis burns qurans there's silence. it's double standards? @vodkaninja @mrtickle3 you've been on twitter too long.. :) not everyone is a zealot or foaming at the mouth. ppl can be reasonable. @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja me too but i still don't see any mass protests against this group rampaging through iraq, burning qurans (jonah tomb) @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja i don't buy that the iraq intervention was the only cause behind isis- sa &amp; wahabbis have a lot to answer for here. @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja following your own logic you should at least be angry at us (or rather those who wanted war in iraq) &amp; mass protest @mrtickle3 @vodkaninja so if we create a blasphemous book it's our problem &amp; millions protested against us..but if we create isis killers... rt @josephwillits: surely un #gaza enquiry is of more importance than amal alamuddin's status as george clooney's fiancée?
