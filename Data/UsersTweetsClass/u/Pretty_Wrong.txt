"well rid". you hear that, scotland? http://t.co/x4ac1gfd9b @indiaknight @gillian_philip @victoriapeckham and we believe that the choice we are making is right for scotland. it's called democracy. @indiaknight @gillian_philip @victoriapeckham we are intelligent and informed. we have researched, read and made our decisions independently @indiaknight @gillian_philip @victoriapeckham i am scottish with an english husband. we are both yes voters. we don't "hate" anyone. @ladymunter @nundmc @martin_compston oh, really? http://t.co/rvbgohs2k1 @soul_of_twit @nundmc what he's not mentioning is that he's english and originally from the south east and is voting yes. he is awesome. feels like a new beginning and there's so much to explore. it's not so crazy thinking we could really have it all... &lt;3 roisin murphy @nundmc lovelyyyyyyyyyyyy! @profanityswan we have a spare room. @bettiezz yeahhhhhhhh! this is by far the strangest pro indy thing i've seen. http://t.co/4mcjd2hd5c @aboylikethom @nundmc can't dm as you don't follow me. m, can you? @aboylikethom @nundmc me! push the boat out, companeros, push the boat out whatever the sea... me, for the next four days. “@emergencypugs: http://t.co/dm8qkucs8e” @nundmc @imump smws. @imump and whisky. and wine. and night nurse. @notlucette referendum nerves! @imump if i make it off the pan over the next four days, it'll be a miracle. aye, it's you raise me up in italian. yous never saw that coming, did yous? #xfactor i want to keep him in a cupboard for sad days. #xfactor i was less nervous four days before my wedding than i am four days before #indyref. @baron_obtuse @lesleyriddoch @nicolasturgeon @patrickharvie @vonny_bravo @womenforindy yes, absolutely. very engaging speakers all round. it was an absolute privilege to hear @lesleyriddoch @nicolasturgeon @patrickharvie and others talk so passionately and positively today. "people here are learning to become the change they want to see" lesley riddoch @imump homophobe. @basedreznor it was so perfect-looking i thought it was a fur stole or something. poor wee basturt. deid fox reported to @glasgowcc thanks to 101 who had ooh number. poor wee guy deserves a bit of dignity :( great. @glasgowcc's switchboard is only open mon-fri 9-5. so a fox corpse will be lying on a public footpath for at least a day. great. there's a dead fox on the pavement by queens park as you walk up to battlefield, just past the ivory. anyone know who to notify? @glasgowcc someone's watched high fidelity a lot. #xfactor molly ringwald was stupid not to fall for him. #xfactor 250ml glasses of wine are my mid-afternoon kryptonite. just tried to do my mum's hair and made her look like vivienne westwood. she brushed it out. rt @gibbzer: buchanan street is rammed with yes supporters. a moment ago they were singing 'we still love you even if you're no' #indyref can the media please stop perpetuating the myth that a "family" means children? thanks. @whiteanklesocks just make sure you avoid the orange walk... @betsymartian @soul_of_twit @salihughes just bought tom ford oud wood. oooft. although i wish they hadn't given it the masculine rebranding. @eops it's bloody brilliant. i hope it motivates other (perhaps disaffected) voters across the rest of the uk. @eops my bones ache with it. it is in my very core. feel like i've been running for weeks. but seeing so many people engaged is heartening. @eops it's exhausting and emotional and exciting. can't sleep, can't stop thinking about it. totes emosh. @eops :)))))))))))))) @mrssjwho @andyparmo i take it the dead robin i saw the other day means "no-one gives a fuck about you, love"? rt @sbutlerbooks: it is #roalddahlday...

me: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo “@nundmc: it's clare grogan day. a hot lass from cumbernauld has just danced in my bath” this is me must remember that @nundmc is an old man now, and me dancing round the house to altered images is not good for his heart. happy old day. @flamingnora it's nice enough, but i'm not a good judge. i like really dirty fragrances, so it's too femme for me. this dress was £7 and i have nowhere to wear it to and the room is a mess but isn't it awesome. http://t.co/oaevi3egwo heading oh god yet again i'm handing home from a tom ford counter, late and pissed. he just went "do you want to talk to me?" in a way that took me back to being hit on by a pure ride in the dancing. i am weak. omg hot charity guy on argyle st with fit beard and the bluest eyes almost got me to stop. @jehealey @thehausofkunte you can feel my shade face from 100 paces. ask @nundmc and @imump. @jehealey @thehausofkunte my shade face game is strong. listening to bootylicious. life. today i am serving jane russell boss bitch statement coat eleganza. you bet your ass i'll stand by you and give you shade face until you move your bag from the empty seat, lady. it didn't pay for a ticket. @joniosity in my defence one of them was in an old man boozer and we got in a takeaway from the kebab shop across the road. @joniosity no, it's a new one. they're getting married at the eden project and he bought the dress off ebay from china. yes, because on the day you make a commitment to someone else for life, it's the dress that really, really matters. #dttb every day i praise the lord that i successfully bought a wedding dress without stepping into the hell that is a wedding dress shop. #dttb need to be more assertive when unsolicited charity reps turn up at my front door, instead of making up lies about boiling pots. @daniel_orton @rushmalai but the toy boy rap, no? i think that i listen to too much stock aitken waterman. and then i imagine what would've gapped if sonia had had kylie's success. and then i need to lie down. then i think about the raps from toy boy by sinitta and boys by sabrina and i know that the toy boy rap is better, but what if i'm wrong? sometimes i listen to "never gonna give you up" and i think what even are you trying to say, rick. omg lads mary kiani's appearing at the waterloo on friday and i'm out of town. shite. ban people who huddle at the front of the bus instead of moving up the aisle and/or sitting down. ban them to fuck. @rushmalai @nundmc oh em gee. i think you can do a one-to-one bespoke gin consultancy with cambridge gin. £300 or so iirc. fashion need. http://t.co/qnfmdeq1v7 @spacegirlgail @allornothingmag the dogs! best business name http://t.co/z56gvgfwug this week @nundmc and i will be in london. if anyone wants to stand near us and breathe in our eleganza, you'll find us where the gin's at. @eddo_ percol instant espresso is perfection, but. #deluxebitchlifestyle http://t.co/jvecv3zt3k @yvesm @tapaorganic @glasgowlocavore it's a pop up market thing, but not shite-sounding. djs and stuff. @yvesm @tapaorganic @glasgowlocavore are you going to that hing at the (soon to be) rum shack?
