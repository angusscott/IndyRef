it's not. seriously considering moving to t-mobile though. love @johnlegere and what‚Äôs he doing over there. $aapl $tmus this way i can now get my 6 for $499. $aapl had i bought the iphone 5s it would have been off contract ($900), and that would have meant iphone 6 would have been same thing. $aapl i‚Äôve never used touchid. i didn‚Äôt buy the iphone 5s. excited to try it out on my 6. passwords are annoying. $aapl but iphone‚Äôs annual sales #s will stop growing after next yr. by x-mas 2017 (for iphone 7) there growth will be coming from elsewhere. $aapl they‚Äôll be able to maintain iphone sales #s for a while after because as china‚Äôs middle-class grows there‚Äôs growth potential there. $aapl this way you can still beat comps next year but i would suspect next year is also peak high-end smartphone sales. $aapl if you keep the same form factor you‚Äôll also be improving battery life next year and those are the two most requested improvements.$aapl #6s i think leaving out sapphire was a smart move this generation. gives a pretty compelling reason to buy the 6s. $aapl 10-11m iphone‚Äôs sold in opening weekend sounds right. i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd want to do more than that. $aapl apple sold 9m 5s‚Äôs and 5c‚Äôs last yr, muenster says they‚Äôll do 10m phones this yr, and apple already confirmed new pre-order records. $aapl i‚Äôm sure if apple wanted to they could sell 15m phones opening weekend, but there‚Äôs multiple advantages to limiting supply for initial lunch apple doesn‚Äôt want to beat last year‚Äôs opening wknd sales numbers by too much cause it makes next yr‚Äôs comps more difficult. $aapl gee, ya think? http://t.co/9psmwj7iwz @cerebraltrades i like it @cerebraltrades $pay prob good to buy monday cause even if square/paypal bought should see some action @cerebraltrades but square is hotter and more mobile focused. @cerebraltrades absolutely. i think square has good connections and smart, important people behind it too. paypal more established. @cerebraltrades that‚Äôs a good point. it slipped my mind. either would be good prob. one will be necessary. google needs to acquire their way into that segment. the $6b is couch money to apple, and that really leaves google in a shitty spot. they already have a bad relationships with banks. thinking out loud, but, what if as a defensive move apple went in a just said to square ‚Äúhere‚Äôs $6b come with us.‚Äù who‚Äôs left for google? i think it‚Äôs a very good move on google‚Äôs part if they do buy square. it‚Äôs the best way to compete with apple pay. sounds like square is trying to get their price up. obv google is buying them.  take that to the bank. ‚Äúnope‚Äù rt @theloop: on the rumor that apple was in talks to buy square - http://t.co/bjsgstmc1d cc: @greenjaytrading it‚Äôs the same as the market share argument. it completely ignores where apple is really making it‚Äôs money. but realize that apple is competing on lifestyle, not on specs. so this idea that apple plays catch-up with specs is just a distraction. and that‚Äôs perfectly valid. everyone is different. being an android user is an expression of who you are. but the only thing it expresses is you think apple sheep are douchebags. an apple product is an expression of who you are. an android product is a utility. that‚Äôs why they compete less than you think. i was so tired today i fell asleep 4:01pm...just woke up. what a week. apple has made some next-level hires over the past couple years. time to focus that energy on the pr dept. $aapl maybe it's specious reasoning but it couldn't be a coincidence that katie cotton leaves and apple pr has it's worse 3wks in a decade. $aapl modern day gladiators pumped full of drugs and treated like they're above the law. that's gonna end well. lewis and rice should go on tv together on sunday and talk about how at least they don't beat kids. two days ago on espn i watched a murderer say his situation was diff than the wife beater's. cause that's all football/bro culture does. maybe as a society we should decide not to turn these young men into trained killers will giant ego's. so football has jumped the shark, right?

#drdre great job uncle tim, but i could have done without bono. why not dre instead? what demo are we targeting here, @tim_cook? i‚Äôm not saying the rest of the industry won‚Äôt adapt, but no one is close to being set up for this. this was a shot across the bow of the entire industry. you can‚Äôt compete with apple on specs anymore. and that‚Äôs all google and android do guarantee you start seeing $amzn and $goog do bold (and probably stupid) things in reaction to that apple event yesterday. $aapl @sbanawan this is a very big process‚Ä¶look at these like ipods, and the one‚Äôs that will really be game changers will be more like iphones @sbanawan then after a few gen‚Äôs they really start to make models that you‚Äôll never need (or want) to get rid of @sbanawan 1st few gen‚Äôs are going to be obsolete, but ppl will still buy them for novelty and the fact that they do a lot of cool things @sbanawan of course they‚Äôll make new models just like watch and jewelry companies, but you‚Äôll still want to keep your old ones. @sbanawan they need to be ‚Äútimeless‚Äô so to say. in a few gens you‚Äôll be able to change the insides at an apple store @sbanawan to make the watch any thinner‚Ä¶at that point it‚Äôs just about changing the insides‚Ä¶and when people drop huge money on these things @sbanawan yes i know what you meant. the point is that turning these times into fashion changes that. within a few years you won‚Äôt be able this goes way beyond apple. apple is just executing on every level right now.you will see how important the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù eco system is very soon @sbanawan that‚Äôs the point. it‚Äôs not ‚Äútech‚Äù anymore. all of a sudden ‚Äúdumb‚Äù objects are going to be slowing us down to the point it will be unbearable. people will demand instant change. $aapl how fucking massive is that?

if yes why didn't anyone proclaim it? @weezymiyagi seeing what the vibration was and ignoring it @weezymiyagi and my point is you'll be able to do things with watch apps you can't do with phone apps and vice versa @weezymiyagi it's 3 seconds times 400 times a day rt @weezymiyagi: @freemrktcptlst man people dont think twice about whipping out their phones. look around you. its the norm. its modern cul‚Ä¶ @weezymiyagi are apps on the iphone superior to ones on the desktop? no. they are different ways of computing and each has advantages &amp; dis @weezymiyagi name one example in history where humans eschewed convenience for a more complicated way of doing something. name one. @weezymiyagi of course it is. it's ridiculous, rude and obtrusive to whip out a phone constantly @weezymiyagi again you're not a developer. you don't design apps. you're deciding what the public wants ir needs based on what? @weezymiyagi based on what you think users want and need. unless you called the last two products down to the spec why is your point valid? @weezymiyagi it's cause "users" have no clue what they want or need @weezymiyagi why didn't users "ask" for an iphone in 2006? or an ipod in '99? @weezymiyagi them* @weezymiyagi how do users know what's important to then? @weezymiyagi yes @jackhbarnes nice @jackhbarnes so cool @jackhbarnes ha awesome‚Ä¶i love it @jackhbarnes lol i can't stop thinking about how cool it'd be to e-tap a girl on the wrist. the messaging actually seems kinda killer. but i'll give it a shot since critics are gaga wasn't too excited rt ‚Äú@yahootv: fox's "gotham" is the critical favorite of the new season: http://t.co/0nx86p7zrv http://t.co/blmhjfkej1‚Äù @danielmarquard heard nothing about battery life and that's a bad thing. i'd bet it needs to be charged everyday. @jackhbarnes google now so much better @jackhbarnes i actually use siri a lot for replying to texts and setting my alarms, but far from a personal assistant she is. all that said. this was not what i was expecting. i don't know what i was expecting, but it wasn't it. i'm reality curious though. i want to play with it. but i felt the same way about siri and that got old fast. @danielmarquard even i would like to see proof of concept before i drop that much on a smartwatch @danielmarquard yeah it's nice and understated. i'm thinking maybe avoid the $1k one until second gen. should be much thinner. that's the goal here. and i don't think we'll know if they've done it until nxt yr after it's released. a few of these features could work. was the original iphone really a good smartphone experience as you know it today? not at all. it was novel and did a few things well. again apple is way ahead of the curve here. apple has dream team to make this concept a reality. there's no reason to doubt they can do it. arehndts, deneve, blahnik, newson, ive... @danielmarquard it is. and they come in yellow-gold and rose-good. i like the yellow though many will think it's ostentatious we need a few killer apps and a bunch of people to own them for it to be a quality experience. that will take a few years. gonna be the exact same thing with iwatch if it is successful. there were no apps or network speeds fast enough to create a quality experience. iphone hit it's stride at the 4s release. iphone was way ahead of its time. when it dropped there was no infrastructure to support wht we know as a quality smartphone experience tday i assume the fourth gen is about when we'll be getting the actual iwatch. the design is nice but the tech obv isn't there yet. too thick. but so was the first ipad. what do i want in gen 2? thinner, more screen area, all the health sensors gurman talked about. that'd be a sick watch. the yellow-gold one with the red band is pretty. will look nice with a gold iphone. @catwoman2011 happy birfday, yo @billyeichner http://t.co/ath8cn8jyy @alextarhini_ why?
