it's not #opendata if it's closed for machines! @frankdesaer #ddays14 #sad @chrismckee @pietercolpaert @frankdesaer seems more like #openwash than #opendata at kbo @pietercolpaert ok for kbo to charge for a soap guaranteed service only if bulk data can be downloaded free of charge with an open licence rt @pietercolpaert: "you can ask money for #opendata" @frankdesaer are you sure you didn't mean psi? go speak at a psi conf, not at an #ope… rt @pietercolpaert: stop the presses. there is no #opendata to be found in 2014 for the kbo. psi? maybe... #ddays14 &lt; very disappointing :-( @nashtysmans i'll try, but in the mediaeval surroundings where #ddays14 is being held there is a severe shortage of power plugs! @nashtysmans essentially actively curating - or perhaps 'herding' - #opendata.  it's even more difficult than cats. at #ddays14 there's someone from flanders government with the jobtitle "databeheerder" #opendata rt @giacecco: open, collaborative notes from #ddays14 day 2 are live at http://t.co/x2zxfhb8xk , please contribute! #opendata rt @juliaglidden: 9 year old creates app that works in 3 continents thanks to citadel tools!!! #ddays14 http://t.co/uieu95liif un #egov 2014 trends: co-creation, data sharing, mobile, social, digital divide, #opendata, customer-centric - @richardkerby at #ddays14 "un #egov 2014 themes: e-participation, whole-of-government, multi-channel, usage, digital divide, #opendata" says @richardkerby at #ddays14 at #ddays14 in ghent @richardkerby challenges the audience to name the belgian government cio #govit #egov "no-one goes to a government website for fun" says @richardkerby at #ddays14 #egov "should it be unlawful for an e-government service to ask you for information it already holds?" asks @richardkerby at #ddays14 #egov @rbuijsman i downloaded the link the speaker gave. was it even worse until recently then? rt @pduchesne: @openbelgium quality of a conf can be measured to how painful it is to choose between tracks. it's an agony here at @dataday… rt @bartrosseau: btw, fourth edition of #appsforghent will take place on sat 22nd of march... http://t.co/x93fmxsny4 #opendata at #ddays14 we must choose either a talk on #opendata by the brilliant @shevski or a talk on "semantic interoperability". difficult ;-) @pduchesne the licence http://t.co/vrwe5etnjd does not look open - so why is it being presented at the open belgium part of #ddays14? the wallonia geoportal data licence http://t.co/vrwe5etnjd - it does not look like #opendata! #ddays14 /cc @katleenjanssen "most of the geoportal datasets are free but subject to a licence" - so are they #opendata or not? #ddays14 +1 rt @wouterwalgraeve: "run a website on top of #opendata, not the other way around."  #ddays14 rt @mareelge: the most remarkable venue for a conference in the world #ddays14 http://t.co/tihm9qdi7k&lt; and the fewest power points! rt @osm_be: it physically hurts us seeing a google map in an #opendata talk! we can help!  http://t.co/ecw4b5jkle #ddays14 rt @cathrinelippert: mt @dirdigeng: +1 mt @wouterwalgraeve: i hear still too many excuses in this debate for not opening up data &lt; more exc… at #ddays14 @opendataforum_ assumes #opendata is a cost to government: yet growing examples of govs saving money overall @bartrosseau @rbuijsman however by all means prioritise #opendata which people have requested @bartrosseau @rbuijsman govs should release #opendata unless there's a strong reason why not: they shouldn't spectulate about its use. rt @shevski: impressive history of #opendata in flanders. spot on concept note from 2011 to make open the default in government #ddays14 new flemish #opendata platform based on @ckanproject and integrated with @thedatatank - to be launched tomorrow 1200 datasets #ddays14 three (or more) star #opendata in less than 15 minutes with @thedatatank #ddays14 (nb @citadel_eu) @joostjakob yet difficult to get change in law until there are good examples of real benefit from #opendata - chicken &amp; egg! #ddays14 @katleenjanssen if there's a privacy argument against making train times #opendata i say "bring in on" #ddays14 @katleenjanssen if there's a privacy argument about making train times #opendata i say "bring in on" @mvcomper work with the people writing party manifestos, get parties competing to do most #opendata for transparency and economic growth? +1 rt @wouterwalgraeve: i hear still too many excuses in this debate for not opening up data to be honest #ddays14 "belgium did badly in open data index because @okfn asked the wrong questions" - perhaps providing more #opendata might help too? #ddays14 rt @peterdesmet #ddays14 @shevski: #opendata isn't about personal data, it's about budget, public transport, etc. #privacy is not the issue @mvcomper even better to get the political commitment to #opendata as part of the election platform #ddays14 "personal data isn't #opendata, it's my data" says @shevski #ddays14 "if it's ok to release data to somebody then it should be released to everybody" says @shevski #ddays14 #opendata rt @peterdesmet: #ddays14 a good "only once" principle would be: don't share data between governments, but share it as #opendata. everyone … "without political commitment it's hard to get public institutions to provide #opendata" #ddays14 rt @openbelgium: think re-use from the beginning! #opendata #ddays14 @datadays2014 with belgium's constitutional structure, the eu #opendata (#psi) directive has to be transposed into local legislation 7 times #ddays14 belgium has 2 federal #opendata portals #ddays14 start of #datadays14 at ghent's city museum #opendata http://t.co/t8bxbcjepj rt @talkaboutlocal: courts listing data – one step back http://t.co/pjgvedzllm rt @nigel_shadbolt: a uk information infrastructure needs real time river levels, flood warnings and alerts as #opendata rt @owenboswarva: #floodhack and opening up @envagency flood data http://t.co/syupmjmwce &lt; good post: long way from #opendata at env agency rt @michelinecasey: france is modernizing its #opendata approach http://t.co/ilg5rwuj79 @tshadwell i would like to follow up on the fco hackday.  could you follow me so i can dm you please?
