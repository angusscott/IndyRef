nice, but fake. @elisabethf46 aren't we voters supposedly required to vote in a local rep to take our concerns to form a fedgov? to govern for us? so, if the unelected can develop policies for the govt? so why us voters aren't doing it too? @elisabethf46 if you rt this, it may help readers to understand a little bit more.

gaia will rise again when, oh when are we going to stop the rape of this beautiful, unique land? so, abbott made a faux pas in only including 'real' australians in the death toll of #mh17 and ignored permanent residents? explain to me why asylum seekers are evil.
they're humans. they want  a better life. they need to belong.
i understand that. are we looking at the new wave of economic managmt with #mh370 and #mh17? engineered to gain mrkt prominence? followers are my flowers who enhance my twitterings. you make me real and worth listening to in my silent world.
