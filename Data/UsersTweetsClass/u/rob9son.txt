(also not a progressive policy - free to vulnerable i'm england too) @fewarepict some numbers in that are highly disputable, such as 4th most unequal. a very pessimistic view of the uk. @moritzkraft @fewarepict england doesn't even vote as a block!! all about dividing people! nice chatting. bye. @fewarepict absolutely not. same pressures, same people. external influences may have greater sway due to smaller economy if anything. @b0mbskare @fewarepict @stevesayers1 more tax drives people and jobs south. becomes more difficult. is improve euphemistic for cut?

further devolution? reform? all are compatible with no. @neiledwardlovat only problem is the i've felt this before. concerned that rationality went out the window a long time  ago. @fewarepict @stevesayers1 because you asked a question. our deficit is higher than ruk and we're more exposed to banks/oil. biggest risk. @fewarepict @stevesayers1 i understand that some yes voters genuinely don't care about the consequences. independence at all costs. @fewarepict @stevesayers1 "please don't vote yes for even more cuts"?

@a_d_mclean @stevesayers1 pure conjecture. nhs will be free at point of use for all and funding isn't being slashed. @yestoscotland point is there won't be any extra money. increased costs likely to squeeze budget. nice to see your compassion for scots jobs @yestoscotland scotlands contribution to trident is tiny compared to welfare budget. never mind all the jobs supported by faslane. @yestoscotland relative to absolute poverty again. there is nothing in independence that suggests alleviating poverty. it creates new costs. @yestoscotland of course there is! http://t.co/ti2os8sm9l poverty is awful but independence isn't the answer #nothanks #indyref @minion_mcminion @planet_pedro @historywoman @blairmcdougall who's ignoring problems?

@wingsscotland @dhothersall i suspect you don't care. just not sure why you don't put the issue to bed with a straight answer. @wingsscotland @dhothersall your evasiveness on the subject has been either a) suspicious or b) mind boggling childish. why not just answer rt @agentp22: more lies from yes scotland.

claiming that westminster will privatise an nhs which is devolved to holyrood.

liars. http://t… @minion_mcminion @historywoman @blairmcdougall higher food prices would really help those struggling to afford food as it is. @yestoscotland not necessarily. besides, the snp want to lower taxes if anything. @minion_mcminion @historywoman @blairmcdougall that and the increased costs. supermarkets have spoken on the issue http://t.co/uqnjvwvjho @bethwatt2014 spending cuts bringing deficit down in order to bring down debt, did you miss the recession? @bethwatt2014 except both socialist solidarity and free market capitalism don't support it. nationalism all that's left. @bethwatt2014 no, we choose to find solutions rather than resort to knee jerk nationalist isolationism. @yesscotland uk employment at a record high, growth amongst the fastest in the developed world, imagine jeopardising it all #nothanks @yestoscotland , you know eventually you may have to answer a couple of experts rather than discrediting them all. @yestoscotland what is better, high standard of living for poorest or narrowest gap between rich and poor? @bethwatt2014 governments worldwide have tried to eradicate child poverty and food bank. no new credible plan from the yes campaign. .@bethwatt2014  what an arrogant and blatantly untruthful comment. typical of the whole yes campaign i'd say #nothanks .@yestoscotland depends what you mean by rich, and what you mean by fairer. icas suggest wiggle room is limited. http://t.co/5lu2rdhu69 civic nationalism at its finest, http://t.co/qlhxmm55wy and in the comments too. #indyref #nothanks http://t.co/ftwchsdxmp cue predictable scramble to detract from #letsstaytogether an inherently positive and well intentioned message. love-bombs away! staying together is the forward looking positive choice for scotland. follow @wakeuptobreakup  #letsstaytogether #indyref rt @dhothersall: thank you @wakeuptobreakup. like turning the final corner in a marathon and seeing all your friends gathered to cheer you … revealing that the nats celebrate the fact that someone wasn't directly ruling out eu membership. setting a pretty low bar for success. @jimhumehume @davidmmilne usual nat tactic of quick subject changes i see. dividing the country over party politics is mad. @jimhumehume @davidmmilne we already govern ourselves. represented in 3 parliaments. breaking a country for the tories is mad. @jimhumehume @davidmmilne well the uk wouldn't since scotland would be outwith. the risk outweighs the cost. all avoidable with a no vote. @jimhumehume @davidmmilne that has nothing to do with owning the currency. there is no way of forcing the ruk to accept currency union. @jimhumehume @davidmmilne you can't  own a share of a currency. you don't care who controls the currency? what's the point of indy? @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture quicker but you have no idea where you'll end up! won't be worrying about an oil dep with no currency/eu. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture it's a far shorter road through reform than through the foundation of a new state with so many unknowns. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture  actually some of those are false if joining eu (vat and immigration). also giving up control on currency. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture easy to say that, but easier to achieve within union than without with new pressures and less control. reform. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture in a euro election, reflected across europe... this risk is unnecessary and offers little in the way of reward. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture  which could already happen if the scottish government wanted it to. putting up barriers to ruk solves nothing. @scotlandsfuture @scotconyes definitely, that's what bothered me about the "can't" poster. nobody says that. it's "shouldn't". @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture apart from the scottish one presumably. localism is not supported by national isolation. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture we can, and we do. union allows us to be part of something bigger and still have a say in 3 parliaments. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture they're not mutually exclusive and most don't want independence at any cost. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture rich enough to go it alone yes. richer no. worth the cost and risk? absolutely not. @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture so why cite it in a conversation of relative wealth? to distract from scotland's higher deficit? @scotconyes @scotlandsfuture you realise that debt is scotland's too right? higher deficit and a share of the debt. @realjohnnyfear @dhothersall @yesscotland says the campaign that has made hay with the negative casting of better together. union = unity @realjohnnyfear @dhothersall @yesscotland breaking a 300 year old political union is necessarily divisive. pretending otherwise is bizarre @rkingphoto @scotlandsfuture @adbremner devolution is already delivering more powers regardless of #indyref! wilful ignorance. @scotlandsfuture must be tiring for them reciting the mantra.
