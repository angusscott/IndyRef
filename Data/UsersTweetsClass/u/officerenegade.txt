(surprise) #adminchat a6. this is honest. i love it. #adminchat wow.. we really only have 5 minutes left? #adminchat a5. best practice is to keep the question short &amp; relevant #adminchat a5. most wait until the end of presentation for q&amp;a. if it's a software demo, ask them to repeat the steps #adminchat a5. if not, just ask before they start- "will you take questions during or after your presentation?"
#adminchat a5. my experience is most speakers will address this at the beginning of the session. #adminchat a4. oh! and try to remember to thank the exhibitors for supporting your organization. #adminchat
focus on vendors you may utlize. a4. i even make suggestions on how to improve current products or offerings #adminchat a4. this is  your opportunity to ask about their services or products. #adminchat a4. bring your business card to drop off or use your phone to scan qr codes at booth #adminchat a4. and, when looking for specific product. put a task on calendar to  help you remember to ask about it #adminchat a4. best to review the list of exhibitors ahead of time- maybe map out their booth location #adminchat rt @officerenegade: how about the next ? @lucybrazier aka rachael. :) #adminchat how about the next ? @lucybrazier aka rachael. :) rt @taskittous:i came in late quiet today? there are some hiccups..but otherwise  perhaps it's just quiet #adminchat. stalkers +1 rt @lucybrazier:i like to go for "i'm really looking forward to seeing / meeting....." or "have you seen them before?" #adminchat a3. networking (imo) is a really important part of conferences. not everyone feels the same about it. @taskittous agreert @taskittous: networking can be challenging but at a conference isn't everyone there for gen. the same reason or ancillary reasons? anyone there? helloooo? lol!  #adminchat a3. i go with 'i never know what to talk about at these events. "what do you think so far?" --usually works. #adminchat any thoughts to add? a3. i find that most people at conferences are also feeling uneasy about networking #adminchat.. cont'd [not me, though!] a3. it's hard to avoid talking to others at conferences #adminchat i think it's polite to acknowledge seatmates @lucybrazier let's move on! :) #adminchat how's everyone doing today? #adminchat. it's almost a holiday weekend here in the states. labor day. we're on holiday, monday. a2. i've paid my own way for courses i found important. saved up the $$ and went. the initiative surprised the co. ceo. #adminchat sorry.. lost you guys there for a sec! #adminchat a2. tenacity is key. showing the value is key to success. #adminchat a2. and, if they say no, come back and ask for half support. or,mileage reimbursement. never hurts to ask. #adminchat a2. and if you share the knowledge gained w/your company peers, you're saving the company even more  $$ #adminchat told you today would be feisty ;) for #adminchat... a2. is creating presentations in the latest program the best use of your executive's time? #adminchat a2. the pa takes the course at $200 for the day &amp; then creates 20 new prezis based on $30/hr earnings #adminchat a2. what's more valuable to your company? an exec. that earns $300/hr doing their own prezi, or con'td.. #adminchat a2. an example would be that you want to attend a day long prezi conference (cont'd) #adminchat a2. you have to be able to present a business case that shows the financial value derived from your attendance. #adminchat a2. that's an entire #adminchat all on its own!  it's important to show how it benefits the co. &amp; the exec a2. it's unfortunate that many organizations do not financially support admin profess.development #adminchat a1. the best one is going to be the one you'll get the most out of-&amp; will improve some facet of your performance #adminchat a1. if there is a skill that you need to improve upon- look for a conference that covers it #adminchat a1. the most important ? to ask is why do i want to attend an admin conference? education? networking? #adminchat rt @lucybrazier: q1.  there are so many conferences! how do i know which is the best one? #adminchat a1. right? we're so lucky to have the choices that we have today! it shows just how far our profession has come.#adminchat thanks.. *blushing* rt @officedynamics: i'm so excited for #adminchat with @officerenegade, kemetia foley! good to talk about tradeshows and conferences when so many of them take place sept., oct, nov! #adminchat hi,  everyone! #adminchat.  my responses may have a delay.. twubs is not working for me today. i'm happy to be here, though. tweet storm this hour #adminchat. join us! #adminchat  phew!  just made it in from the crazy traffic here! in time to do this! great opportunities to learn! get the most from  attending conferences &amp;  tradeshows. we talk on #adminchat today at 1pm et. looking forward to the #adminchat today. going to be speedy w/ lots of info! see you at 1pm eastern #keeplearningkeepgrowing rt @brucevh: discipline is just choosing between what you want now and what you want most. - @rory_vaden http://t.co/ku4v3kr71v @brendamonahan thanks for the shoutout! :)  *waving* from nova ready to #adminchat -conferences &amp; tradeshows today at 1pm eastern. join me and   @lucybrazier -thx to @pa_assist,our sponsor. thx to @pa_assist,our sponsor for #adminchat - today's topic-&gt;conferences &amp; tradeshows at 1pm et join me and @lucybrazier trying to catch up w/ me this fall?

 #adminchat a12. i use two tools, my timesheet and my annual review folder. #adminchat a11. data entry can be tedious, but so! important to do it well. it can impact your organization's database integrity #adminchat a11. say data entry, which you despise,is a big part of your job you may want to re-evaluate your job situation #adminchat a11..you have an opportunity to take it on and surprise your supervisor with the level of improvement #adminchat a11. i don't care for it. it's a very tiny part of my job. so really, i'm not going to risk getting written up over it. #adminchat a11. i do a live announcement over our co. paging system every week &amp; it’s weird to hear my voice across the broadcast system. #adminchat a11. is it (the task) really so awful? really? #adminchat a11. it's important to  measure what percentage of your job requires you to do this task. #adminchat
cont'd a11. i love this ! so honest, right?!  #adminchat
 #adminchat rt @lucybrazier: a9 i would point to @bonnielowkramen and her point that most managers don't get trained until they are 42! you heard that … a10. because g+ is already tied into search engines and owns youtube. and google hangout #adminchat a10. i'm a huge fan of twitter and twitter lists. googleplus is becoming a fast fave. #adminchat a9. you have to show supervisors how it makes their life easier and saves the company $$$ #adminchat @lucy.. are we on q9&gt;?  i've lost us. .:) #adminchat i know there are lots of amazing to-do apps out there- but remember the milk is my fave #adminchat a8. i use my voice recorder on my phone- as soon as i know i can't forget something &amp; attach it to my calendar. #adminchat @lucybrazier phew! this is really speedy today! #adminchat @mireilleeava good point.. important when you've got multiple managers #adminchat #adminchat a8. that helps me start right on track because my mind gets distracted by my teenager when i get home! #adminchat a8, and, i create a to-do list of things i need to tackle 1st thing a.m. before caffeine kicks in #adminchat a8. it's absolutely vital that i print the next day's calendar and have it at my monitor for the next morn. cont'd#adminchat let me address the question about daily routine as #8. #adminchat rt @lucybrazier if you follow me on twitter, i am forever posting free resources and our weekly newsletter is full of them #adminchat i think we're on q8.. right @lucybrazier ? #adminchat a7.. lastly, there are great admin trainers out there. connect with them, find out what products they offer. #adminchat a7.. i also purchased a subscription to http://t.co/g7suujtdim, which is a wonderful training tool #adminchat a7. youtube has great how-to videos for many microsoft office products &amp; i love http://t.co/gwkuprz6s8 for cheat guides #adminchat @mypinkbriefcase i'll finish this one and come back to your ? #adminchat a6. subscribe to an e-newsletter, a linkedin discussion group such as executive secretary :), or get exec sec magazine  :) #adminchat a7. be sure to be involved in a professional orgs. for admins. i belong to iaap, asap and a few others. #adminchat a7??. we're lucky to work in a time when there are so many awesome resources #adminchat a6. however, if the work situation is tough-- forward a copy of any coursework completed directly to hr for your file #adminchat a6. you want to demonstrate that you understood where improvements needed to be made &amp; that you're addressing them #adminchat
 #adminchat oops  a6. don't wait until your next performance review a5. don't wait until your next performance review #adminchat a6. discuss work challenges frequently with your supervisor. do. not. let. them. stew! #adminchat a5. i try to do an email archive monthly &amp; a file dump every 90 days -#adminchat @lucybrazier for me..that would be eating too many sweets! #adminchat a5. each country has their own laws regarding essential files. your hr or legal dept. should provide the list for you. #adminchat love it!!rt @lucybrazier “eat that frog” is simply a metaphor for tackling the most challenging task of your day. 
#adminchat and what was it?rt @lucybrazier i love brian tracy's advice about eating frogs #adminchat a4. i have a great admin peer, marie herman, she's my go-to when i have a microsoft office issue i can't quite master #adminchat a4. one more note- for software skill challenges- seek out peers that can recommend helpful resources #adminchat a4. when my focus isn't at the highest level, and i can drink my coffee while i work through it. #adminchat a4. the tasks that are the most tedious are the most challenging for me. i try to save those for friday mornings. #adminchat a4, be honest with yourself. why are there tasks that you avoid? #adminchat true!rt @mireilleeava a4 that makes for an uncomfortable but necessary conversation with oneself.  #adminchat a4. get them to tell you which area/skill is a priority for them! #adminchat a4. make those the priority. if there are multiple matches,set up a time to get insights from your supervisor #adminchat a4. now look at those items. were any of them mentioned in your review? #adminchat a4. and on the back - make 3 columns.  1. tasks you hate 2. tasks you avoid 3. softwares skills that need help #adminchat a4. sit down with your copy of your last performance review (i do hope  you have it in writing!) #adminchat a4. maybe though, we should look at where we struggle before we take on new skills #adminchat a4. do you mean there are so many new skills to learn?  indeed, there are! #adminchat a3. hope this is an example you can relate to-- #adminchat a3. sometimes the softskills are only learned through experience or from a good mentor #adminchat a3. not only that, but my mind was closed to learning from other, more experienced co-workers #adminchat a3. she explained to me that i don’t have to be friends with my co-workers, but i do need to respect them #adminchat
cont'd a3. i was lucky that my supervisor at the time, recognized this behaviour and addressed it privately. #adminchat a3. and still deliver the final project. i believed that i knew better and it seeped into my interactions #adminchat
cont'd a3. and, i didn’t have the experience to know that a co-worker could do his/her job differently  cont'd 
 #adminchat a3. when i first entered the admin field, i was too-focused on being liked and not on how well i did my job cont'd #adminchat @mireilleeava that's interesting..i'll have to do some research on that! #adminchat a2. even when we are feeling slighted, ignored, challenged- handling these interactions maturely refines that skill #adminchat a2. so important, on a professional level, to raise our interpersonal skills to the highest level #adminchat a2. how do people define interpersonal skills anyhow? how do you define interpersonal skill? #adminchat a2. even more important, can be our understanding and use of non-verbal communciation. #adminchat a2. even more important, can be our understanding and use of non-verbal communciation. #adminchat a2. absolutely.  verbal and written communications are skills we use in our workplace, with clients and co-workers #adminchat @lucybrazier indeed! minutes can be zzzzzz! #adminchat a1. of course, today, we're speaking specifically to admin-related work skills #adminchat a1.or, they can be task-type skills like filing, expense reporting, data-entry #adminchat a1 or,soft skills like being pro-active, anticipating conflicting issues, time-management #adminchat a1. they can be technical, as in being an expert in microsoft office 2013 #adminchat soft skills. #adminchat a1. work skills are usually, but not always listed within our job description. #adminchat @lucybrazier thanks for having me. it's been nutty here today! #adminchat there's always the skill or task we can improve upon. sometimes we prefer to avoid them. #adminchat thanks! glad to be here on #adminchat today here i am! #adminchat.. sorry i'm late #adminchat friends &amp; @lucybrazier --running a few minutes behind.. join you in just a few.. thx for understanding! @lucybrazier #adminchat peeps.. running about 3 minutes  late or so.. see you in a few minutes... thx rt @jamilsmith: no, @toddakin.
