@mingmong79 still here, but you knew that. lol, good night @1872chriskerr cool, no worries. good night @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 what's to stop anyone invading switzerland? nato, which we'd be part of. don't need to be nuclear. money! @mingmong79 ok. no hard feelings. just wanted to make you think. may not have worked but i tried at least. good night @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 ...and good luck. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 that may be your problem right there. i know you're ignoring any good points i make so i give up. good night. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 and why don't we have any surface ships in scotland? why are raf bases being closed. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 google it and then decide. do you know how we got devolved powers in scotland. re-draw water boundaries. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 really? when did u check the boundaries last? there's a division between english &amp; scottish coastal waters. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 tell me all about the last terrorist attack on switzerland. foreign policy is crucial. waging wars is gonna hurt. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr extracting oil will happen, but it won't last forever. why let westminster get the taxes revenues from our waters @mingmong79 we need to move away from carbon fuels. scotland leads the world in renewable energy development. @mingmong79 carbon neutral doesn't mean you can't burn trees or drive cars or run factories. it means you put back what you take out. @mingmong79 you think i'm a wholloper? i'm still talking to you. politicians don't give a fuck. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 even if it's gone in 30 years (google claire field &amp; bp videos/clyde/trident) that's not a small amount of money. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 you think oil is not important? @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 anti-establishment. i served in the raf. i'm a realist. scotland needs to grow up. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr i'm talking about renewable energy. we have 1 planet, resources are finite. they will run out. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 we get less back than we put in. scottish oil underpins the uk economy. why wm doesn't want scotland to leave... @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 i'm scottish, living in a rich country where we pay more taxes per head than ruk @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 i'm married to an english woman, living in scotland. i'm not anti-english. oh, you will never get it. @mingmong79 you don't want your own country to make decisions for its own people. i don't get it. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr also, ultimately, their power is controlled by westminster's barnett formula, westminster's budget. i.e. limited @mingmong79 yes, they do. personally, i will vote green. this is not about salmond/snp. it is about representation for scottish people. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 even if it gets through parliament, there is now way it will get through the (unelected) house of lords @1872chriskerr have you not seen even the mainstream papers. the tories are already up in arms about cameron's promises. they will say no. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr trust me, the big english cities are crying out for devolution of power from london &amp; watching us closely. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr i agree, we're different in one respect only. we have a chance to make it better. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 it's exactly a vote against westminster. it's about self-rule and self-determination. that's all it's about. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr i'm not talking about oppression, i'm talking about london's centrist policies. the north is fucked too. @mingmong79 @1872chriskerr you're right. we have so much to be thankful for while westminster and it's cronyism screws the rest of the uk. @1872chriskerr no, i'm not really into symbolism or religion. that's just me. btw, i respect the living too. peace. @1872chriskerr freedom, i guess. not being funny in any way, just asking. i was in the armed forces myself &amp; just thought you might be. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 btw, i understand what you're saying about respect. @1872chriskerr @mingmong79 are you guys in the armed forces? @daviecleland @1872chriskerr sorry, my mistake. i don't live in glasgow. sure that's what the bbc said during the commonwealth games. ;-) @1872chriskerr tbh, i think they are respecting what their forefathers fought for: freedom. think a while, stay a while and celebrate. @1872chriskerr ps: why are you so angry? we all have relatives that fought in the war. @1872chriskerr get a sense of humour, embrace irreverence. @1872chriskerr scotland and the scottish are famous for their sense of humour. remember the road cone on the george square statue? @1872chriskerr i very much doubt i'm trying to justify anything that you're imagining. get off your high horse, it's a long way down. @chelseanohistor ps: ran out of characters in the 1st text. i meant you're english grammar, not you're english! peace bro. new at this. @chelseanohistor lol, no worries, i like ya already. btw, there are a few scottish idiots who hate the english. we're not all like that. :-) @kebabmon i disagree, there are plenty grandmothers left in england. @chelseanohistor i assume you meant if they don't vote yes? i'm not a grammar nazi, it's just that your tweet doesn't make sense. english? @marthasydenham no, you should move to scotland where you would be welcomed with open arms. erm, you're not armed are you?
