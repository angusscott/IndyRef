man utd confirm departure of david moyes, reports in spain suggest former aberdeen manager jimmy calderwood is waiting for the phone to ring @simple_john1 i looked at your choices and narrowed it down to five. it's great to play a sport where the company of your fellow competitors is as good if not better than the sport itself. but after the game i had a blether with a guy who lives on the other side of the country and thought no bowls means no blether next year. end of the indoor bowling season today playing in the short mat pairs at stonehaven. played so badly in my last game i'dve happily stopped. @adamgauld5194 ref and linesman could only give a penalty with their view, i'd say the chelsea guy missed everything, sunderland guy slipped never a penalty for sunderland, however as it was against chelsea and jose i can't seem to care. @bbcmotd #no rt @babyanimalpics: why do i have to stop playing http://t.co/aerzmreety all the best to the members and the club and thank you for having us. a fond farewell to drumoak, durris and crathes bowling club as myself and @lookmumicanfly leave after ten years as members. rt @babyanimalpics: don't touch the lava! 🌋 http://t.co/pq9cbqn73m rt @thejeremyvine: in a devastating blow for chelsea, fernando torres has been ruled fit for the game at anfield rt @depresseddarth: star wars chess set http://t.co/15eksgtonn rt @drsciencecat: in case you missed the blood moon last night, this is what it looked like http://t.co/fy7fexqmq9 rt @babyanimalpics: happiest hedgehog ever 😊😁 http://t.co/59rrqxtk8a rt @pharmag_richard: now *that's* how to write a letter of complaint.... http://t.co/ixs6r5wfv1 rt @number10cat: every easter thousands of cats across the uk are abused; don't stand by and let this cruelty happen: http://t.co/zuqurgknrn rt @agentscotland: aberdeen average attendance 2013/14: 12,844 - up 3,234 from 2012/13
