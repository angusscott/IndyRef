it's very wrong for any party leader to dictate the terms of tv debates - never more so than the pm of the day. besides, it looks odd. calling camera men &amp; women: looking for as reasonable priced skilled person as possible to film my wedding on aug 28th. could you help? free tip, youtube apologies are never a good idea as i am sure @nick_clegg would confirm in good spirits. go on nick. give it an rt :) an apology to @jeremyclarkson http://t.co/shbjqxadju and that youtube vid is tongue and cheek because i do genuinely like @jeremyclarkson - people love to kick the man (too much i feel often) @kdot92 it depends, i think on when your pass was issued. i have an english bus pass expiring in 2016. used it a bit lately too. @kdot92 @mayoroflondon so i do not qualify because i do not live in a london borough. i can afford fares, many can't. #equality @kdot92 @mayoroflondon e.g. i was born in westminster, registered disability with london borough of harrow, work in town, live in herts @kdot92 @mayoroflondon understandably it's funded by london council taxpayers but not comparable with equality to have 2 classes of disabled important to know however that english concessionary bus passes are recognised as freedom passes on @tflofficial busses, just not tubes /dlr indeed - but can't see @mayoroflondon extending #freedompass to those disabled commuters. budgets are tight but would be nice. rt @cherrykaz1: @seandilley @tflofficiayes because its so busy at the stations @cherrykaz1 i probably would spend more than i would use that way but would reduce mugging risk at @tflofficial ticket offices :) @cherrykaz1 though wish @tflofficial would consider a £50 or £100 fee to have concessionary passes recognised :) @cherrykaz1 totally @tflofficial staff, most are fine with blind people travelling for free, but some aren't and too risky for me :) @cherrykaz1 i know but it's still an offence - strict liability - at least failing to show on demand as it were. @cherrykaz1 also, most tfl staff either don't know it's not free, or they don't ask because they disagree. it would depend on the revenue officer. staff assume “@cherrykaz1: @seandilley really i've never been asked once to pay on the tube” yup, &amp; not worth risking since you risk a criminal record “@cherrykaz1: @seandilley really i've never been asked once to pay on the tube” #freedompass this is because london councils fund the scheme. i'm happy paying full fare but is fare fair for those who reside outside zone6 did you know: only disabled people living in london may use @tflofficial tubes, dlr? disabled bus passes outside are not recognised. @altontowers keen to do something good and with good pr all around. love magic wand but inquiries take "at least 12 weeks" post deadline :) @altontowers thank you very much indeed. i am sure your pr company were just following rules but felt stonewalled @altontowers_ ah you are a parody account. ok cheers. if anyone at @altontowers could put me in touch with someone who could do a decent deal, 82 charity tickets at low cost for @guidedogs tweet also re @altontowers_  can't approach charity section since it takes "at least 12 weeks" planned @guidedogs trip would be in july. anyone got a good direct contact for merlin entertainment / alton towers. want to do a @guidedogs trip in july. pr not interested... very brave decision by a judge to suspend a trial because legal aid cuts would stop the defendants getting a fair trial. motion by pm's bro. @oovchirrupvoo @welshwallaceart not heard that one but doesn't surprise me. aware of one case where someone could be for similar. these are the top 20 slogans of all time - can you identify them?

agree though. rt @thepdtrust: @seandilley @simmonsbakers so many made-fresh stores donate to charity at end of each day, pret, apostrophe. why no single … lastly - i like @simmonsbakers but who cares if staff or poor people who couldn't otherwise buy goods get food rather than binning it? allegations that @simmonsbakers throw all unsold, unconsumed food away since one cash poor staffer used old stock to feed family. reason i ask @simmonsbakers is a) is it worth you working with food banks if you don't already? also homeless charities? apparently staff at @simmonsbakers may consume surplus stock in store at the end of the day but may not take any home? huge fan of @simmonsbakers but can you please confirm that surplus stock is thrown away at the end of the day? interesting point cam may way @stuartlong01 @guidedogs @sainsburys thanks. my local fundraising branch of @guidedogs partnered with @sainsburys letchworth to raise over £6k. huge thanks &amp; name a pup draw on may 8 @markwrightuk88 indeed - fascinating stuff. rt @markwrightuk88: @seandilley ukip are simply saying whaat a lot of the mainstream are saying just louder and more bullish @policefedicc ha. if only that was what was meant by said person :) one wonders how people who think people might want to move to "a black country" pass the selection process. it's certainly true that #ukip are under a bright spotlight - and it can't be denied the mainstream are worried, certain comments are wrong. @laminx541 @theconstables:@mrpauldavis354 @seandilley have a really safe night and lovely to meet in person :) an example of what @guidedogs seek to highlight re parking on pavements. no way through. http://t.co/a5zh6fta9h @bodycameras very pleased to hear it. he is well liked and well connected. rt @bodycameras: b-cam ltd pleased to announce appointment of richard jones as uk &amp; i sales director @jimallthetime @bbccojo @thebbcacademy appreciate it. really want to fix the issue for others, not just me :) @jimallthetime @bbccojo @thebbcacademy colin savage kindly trained me there &amp; said lovely things - but it's getting the bosses to respond :) @barclaysonline fab thank you. @barclays not a rant at you honestly but that's the longest waitin have had in any bank anywhere ever. i'm served but please help others. @barclays hi there. serious staff shortage in stevenage branch. spent. 30m to lay in - huge queue only 2 positions open. @jimallthetime totally agree. :) enough grimmer - i think the @bbc offers fab entry level opportunities for disabled people but little in terms of bringing outside talent i've a huge cv of things that have not quite happened &amp; @bbc staff / freelance reporting / presenting features highly :) no room at the inn) don't get me wrong, huge fab of the @bbc but alas huge gaps in diversity &amp; inclusivity for those of us with existing experience. @jimallthetime @bbc in my experience the beeb are serious about developing talent and diversity but i can't see tonvt edit so no freelance @jimallthetime genuinely appreciate it but how is the @bbc developing talent other than through entry level opportunities that exclude. this is my problem - i've 15yrs experience“@jimallthetime: @seandilley have you seen the new bbc local apprenticeship scheme?” ignore my last on bbc radio editors - just find it impossible to get in the same room as one to talk presenting :) english regions are fab also , a show i presented with a special interview with @nigel_farage http://t.co/pnzv2uwzre if only bbc editors wanted my presentation :) btw i presented a totally balance programme on gun control within the last heat. i was well behaved :)!http://t.co/iuuxxhxpje @george_c1986 no it's not :) as a former posture yourself you can appreciate that we have all opened a letter :) andy marsh from @acpo sounded great on jeremy vyne on firearms listening. costs of issuing need driving down but public safety is top. and to be transparent, i enjoy shooting shotguns with sighted spotters. fab tactile experience pro tight gun laws. norman baker proposes shotgun &amp; firearms certificates should cost more than £50 (not arguing that point) but shoot a gun at least chap. excellent question by jeremy vyne - shouldn't home office ministers who want to change gun law at least shoot a gun ? @tcoflondon no, you are far from dumb and i don't mean to be sharp. have a lot going on, and this wasn't top of the list :) @tcoflondon yup, now i think about t i'm totally wrong. @tcoflondon but neither can one right off decline by saying people always hunk things used to be better. @tcoflondon it means people complain about society in time and memorial. not a believer in golden age... @tcoflondon not me to y. not a golden age theorist. this poem is why  http://t.co/aoz4usboga @tcoflondon ah now, unlike many on twitter, i hold the view that i may not always be right, but it's possible he was right then, and me now. i had over 12 years working for @talksport who i believe do the best football commentary going - but the politics of footsie = boring :) “@robertrea: @seandilley come on, sean. it's hilarious! :-)” yep, fair point. need a new manager who is good at te 'chase me' game :) @tcoflondon i wrote it. just think there are too many suits in football - no longer a game. seriously it's too money, money, money. can a football manager not lose some games without losing their job?

no, have been in the bars as a lobby journalist with actual or in practical terms authority :) @mchawk hmm ok thanks. right - bed time. thanks to all for catching #bbcpapers - much fun as ever. see you in dreamland, or wake land in 4 hours :) @mchawk yes... it's called "irony" "one of those silly little countries who thinks it needs an army" a reference to poor defence policy here major congratulations to @sainsburys letchworth, working with my fundraising branch of @guidedogs have raised over £5,000 &amp; will name a pup. @mchawk exactly. it's a wonder we were doing it and not you really isn't it :) oh well - guess we slipped through somehow. @hanaoor yet i am the only one to have interviewed the speaker about it, strange given the claims http://t.co/2di10wwijj speaker bercow "there are a number of myths that continue to be perpetuated, one being that the bars here serve very cheap alcohol." (2013) @hanaoor read their words. they don't talk about alcohol sold in bars - they batch bars in with restaurants which are entirely different. @hanaoor @totalpolitics here you are http://t.co/ypyzqberok and note that we interviewed the speaker. @hanaoor hundreds and i have had hundreds of stories of wrong actions which have then been scrutinised. @hanaoor the refreshments department is subbed because the house sits for 8 months not 12. alcohols brings in huge profits. @hanaoor in reality trusted lobby hacks may get served in strangers but it's technically members and officers of the house @hanaoor trust me, i know this area very well indeed and have researched it extensively. re q anyone can visit any bar with an mp... @hanaoor @gregmulholland1 rightly said people are "deliberately mischievous" on commons alcohol reporting. @hanaoor not on cobol. please read my piece for @totalpolitics - a pint is about 3.80 i think so not 1970's life on mars prices. @robinpalmerpr ha well would run with gareth but will be helth dependent for him. congratulations to today's london marathon runners and organisers. up for doing another in future if i can find a victim to join me :) @hanaoor @whichpennysmith @bbcnews there is no subsidy on alcohol sold in commons bars. it's. myth. alcohol brings in huge profits. @hanaoor i wrote about this issue for @totalpolitics mag - do have a read - but i also predicted that drinking may become an "under-culture" @hanaoor i feel it's good for mps to be seen about speaking with constituents, journalists and staff in a less formal setting. @hanaoor i'm of the view that it would be a shame to rob constituents of a beer on the terrace churchill once used &amp; closure would be bad. @hanaoor appreciate the tweet. we won't know what's in the papers till after 9, but all feedback appreciated. @susieqcat1 tv #bbcpapers tonight with @whichpennysmith - join us at 22.30 &amp; 23.30 for our sometimes serious, sometimes irreverent review on @bbcnews @bbqbobs everyone has a difficult job &amp; sexual allegations are sensitive. treat all people equally. @bbqbobs indeed. nigel is a friend and i have and will take every opportunity to defend him. an innocent man. @bbqbobs i would encourage you to listen to the hear hear show i did on this. nearly ended up with truck firms giving legal advice. @bbqbobs i agree. you may wish to leave poor old nigel out of the @ tag on ongoing chat but i'm happy. a hobby horse of mine. @kelvinbhoy i agree totally and always have done. rt @kelvinbhoy: .@seandilley @nigelevansmp which highlights why budgetary cuts on legal aid are fundamentally unjust. everyone deserves the… @bbqbobs @nigelevansmp i presented a hear hear show on it available on itunes. @bbqbobs @nigelevansmp you want see me arguing for any party's policy unless i happen to agree with it. legal aid cuts are criminal. rt @bbqbobs: @seandilley @nigelevansmp tell that to the tory mps who voted for law change. whilst nigel should not be penalised, this law a… outrageous that an innocent man should be 130k out of pocket - a punishment despite the not guilty verdict for @nigelevansmp #unjust very much behind @nigelevansmp 's call for a shake up on the cps returning costs to innocent people with better public interest assessments. tell you what, don't ink i've plugged @talksport enough since leaving, but ts will have top marathon coverage. tune in. wow! 6 years since @talkingsporting &amp; i ram the london marathon together for @guidedogs - fancy another? :) (ducks) good luck runners up doing #bbcpapers with the excellent @whichpennysmith on @bbcnews channel tomorrow. 24h notice to cancel your other plans :) @adamlake hahaha so funny. sorry. well i think various changes have made them more so. how are you my friend ? @adamsonfamily when a vote is called, there are just 8 mins to get to the division lobby. it's really like a village there. @adamsonfamily so if am mp is in at 8am, a normal day would be 4, but they may be there till midnight or later if very committed. @adamsonfamily totally :) ok well mps are in practical terms not allowed to leave even late if there's a big vote after a big day. straw poll - should all bars be shit in parliament?  please say yes / no and ideally why. i'm a no but don't let that influence you :) @givebloodnhs i do appreciate your response thank you. i have actually just raised the general concern in a letter to the health select com. @givebloodnhsi'm just wondering whether this is a widespread problem, and perhaps one mps should investigate? @givebloodnhs today would have been my third donation - but it's not compatible to call for people to give blood then not be able to take it @givebloodnhs thank you. i have and have actually entered a complaint. i want to help &amp; was prevented from doing so. @stuartlong01 nope. they have strict rules but they do not require and do not have licenses. you know, i honestly think parliament's bars should run in tandem with red lion prices and nobody could complain.very close already. @kbu34 haha i am always a becks man. like weak beer when in drinking crowds. it's cheaper than some but more than many. @kbu34 nd. it a hundred percent but pretty sure the marques of grandee neat peter street. honestly had to research this a lot :) @kbu34 slug and letace in victoria or stamford st... the mint hotel behind mollbank, they abbey on abbey orch. rd of victoria at. @kbu34 weather spoons in whitehall is cheaper, dr inks on stamford st. the rose and crown on meymott st. all bar one anywhere @stuartlong01 ha no. they tend to stay open till the end of the sitting day though so finance bill =late shutting. @johnkcrouch was great fun. did about 30 miles to w/hampstead and back. have fun later :) rt @johnkcrouch: @seandilley i spotted you on your tandem this morning, sean.  going like a train.  i'm cycling with the ctc this afternoon… @givebloodnhs as a registered blind guide dog user, i made a real effort to find a location i didn't know. staff unhelpful. feel disrespect. the @givebloodnhs staff were all sitting drinking tea - totally wasted my time and acted like i wanted something from them. bad experience turned up to give blood following a letter from @givebloodnhs in stevenage - took time off and told they couldn't see me b/c rye were busy @bbqbobs best will but covered all of that. the commons owns the bars so doesn't pay rent to itself - and there is not bar specific security @parlprovocateur people should definitely pay. i will join in future. @delstraincomedy yes but you hardly ever see government ministers in there. this is not gov. rt @delstraincomedy: @seandilley indeed sean, but in a society where the gov have done that in spades to most vulnerable. they reap what th… cheers mate. actually just tandem cycled 30 miles so i hope not. “@mattforde: @seandilley you sound pissed” i love how perception becomes reality. people know alcohol is subbed in parliament - yet it is not! and some still argue about the facts @maraschino68 in my timeline this morning :) @parlprovocateur read the last tweet again but will say agin i have never been a member but have been there a lot and never refused service @stuartlong01 don't think it is anymore. last year it was cheaper by 10-20p a pint yet more profit for the house. rt @stuartlong01: @seandilley its cheaper than the red lion just up the street :-) @parlprovocateur not really though is it. i love s&amp;s but have never got round to joining nor have i ever been refused service. will join also please remember there are 16000 palace pass holders and only 650 mps- most of whom don't enter the bars. a pint of beer in strangers is about £3.80 - bottle of house wine is £15 and a coke is £2 from memory. how much do you want to charge?? @dunstablian they do pay for their own poison and there is a major profit to the house which reduces other tuning costs to the taxpayer. bad behaviour by some is never an excuse to legislate for the many. commons authorities have trained staff in refusing service to mps too. @maraschino68 i know. i wrote about them. have a read of my feature forn@totalpolitics - i feel really strongly about this. @bbqbobs false. see my last general tweet. other than s&amp;s, they are run internally by the department of refreshments. the sports and social club is an outside commercial outfit and i believe more money could be raised from a fair rent charge. are you asking me or telling me? by no stretch did i say that. “@maraschino68: @seandilley or for mp's to get sloshed and punch each other.” fact commons bars - strangers etc buys alcohol in much cheaper than most pubs since it is not "tied" to one supplier like others. myth buster - alcohol in commons bars is not subbed it's sold at a huge profit and bars are good for democracy. strong view. @manxboy not sure. think they may eventually be shut at night but this would be bad for democracy as i previously wrote. i did :) “@ivorsawbottom: @seandilley i hope you meant fiancée - otherwise he may have thought you were gay” so in conclusion from me, you will undoubtedly find westminster a sexually charged place but mps are not usually slavering perverts. i have only once been propositioned by an mp who happens to be gay, quite late and mention of my fiancé dashed his hopes. there is one bar in particular where young researchers and no doubt some mps like to go to flirt in my view. i absolutely so not recognise nose of the claims made about commons bars. i wrote this for @totalpolitics http://t.co/ypyzqberok a whole ago @johnkcrouch thanks john. have not renewed the name. will look at it soon :) hope well. lastly, was just saying that eu membership allows eu citizens o move &amp; work across the union @voiceofrussiauk @yvettecoopermp safe night all for the avoidances doubt @voiceofrussiauk i am without party politics &amp; @yvettecoopermp is a lovely person :) happy to have done @voiceofrussiauk today, but dnt agree with being a "critic of @yvettecoopermp - certainly not i was analysing policy. audio support for nigel evans mp https://t.co/rt8ujzize0 via @audioboo rt @stephen_hitchin: @tobyperkinsmp @seandilley in turn it has become a huge problem for our emergency departments. now nigel evans @nigelevansmp has been cleared is it time to return the whip and for him to return to the speakers chair. a&amp;e staff are rightly frustrated when patients present with non emergency matters but if people can't get gp slots, go figure @tobyperkinsmp good on you. sadly the #nhs is sleep walking towards privatisation. more people are paying private gps. sad. rt @tobyperkinsmp: rt "@seandilley

@tcoflondon rape is incredibly serious for instance, but should gbh's be written off as 'not as serious' @tcoflondon that is nit what i am saying nor is that what i think. it is also nit what any tweet has suggested. apples &amp; elephants. @shintomac @sibbymeade please and me details. looking to put in an @guidedogs comedy might soon :) @tcoflondon always have a charged phone and dial 999 and shout "robbery now" nand your location. unit there  dry quickly. @tcoflondon in 22 years, that blind lady has never left her home alone due to disability hate crime @guidedogs @rnib_campaigns it's serious @tcoflondon she had training with mobility instructors and on her second trip out alone, she was abused for being blind... @tcoflondon swear to you 100% real example here. i met a 63yr old lady last year who lost her sight at 41yrs. she learnt route with a stick @tcoflondon criminals need punishing. hate crime is on the rise across the uk &amp; people do die as a result. @tcoflondon agreed. a very serious crime, but seriously to my honestly sincere! please don't mix the issues up.. @tcoflondon please send me info tony. i will raise it and it is surely taken seriously? still though, apples and elephants. @tcoflondon in fairness, i regard them to be more serious than those who target me. apples and elephants :) @shintomac @sibbymeade didn't even know that existed. sounds interesting. is there comedy every night? @tcoflondon @hailolondon you do when you ask theme, that was more of a joke, i ask the suggest @gettaxiuk who aren't greedy. top service. @tcoflondon you follow me and i follow you. neither of us is biased i submit ? @tcoflondon why are my followers biased ! i am followed by politicians of all parties, &amp; journos from all major outlets. @tcoflondon no tony... apples and elephants again. a robbery is more serious than verbal abuse as me example. they're different crimes. @tcoflondon but comparing robberies of cabbies for instance to disability hate crime is comparing apples with elephants. @tcoflondon london cabbies are the finest in the world, i use any that does not use @hailolondon as you know. @tcoflondon this is not just picking easy targets, this is sustained a use targeted at a group because of their group. rt @tcoflondon: @seandilley @sibbymeade @hertspolice and you think they haven't?

@tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice the moment taxi drivers start killing themselves due to targeted abuse is the moment that line works. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice haha, that's a totally different thing tony. a robbery would be more serious than s4a public order act. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade these people aren't masked. they walk up bold as brass. we know because cctv sometimes exists. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade well there you go.. maybe too harsh i don't know but you contradict yourself... now it is that serious? @hertspolice @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice @metpoliceuk every constable swears an oath to act without fear or favour. by enlarge they do. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice @metpoliceuk that's simply not true. look at the amber's a total policing drive for instance. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade what you're not getting is that you can describe an offender visually. we cannot. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade crimes against the person motivated only by their disability is seriously in the rise. we have a problem. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade i get your point &amp; agree. an assault is an assault whoever is assaulted... however disabled people are targeted.. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice i will reply without including poor old herts police from here n, but i can answer you constructively. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice yes, you would get what's called a grade 1 response, think 8m in @metpoliceuk @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice precisely. tony, i am a bit boy. it upsets me, but i can deal with it. it's upsetting my fiancé a lot @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice also, when it's frequent and not just a one off,there's a problem that needs fixing. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice but crucially, it had a real affect on many people &amp; has caused many suicides. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice victimising a blind person, for example is particularly low since we can't describe them. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice yes tony, it is. respectfully i don't think you understand the additional harm done. @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice you can read good info here http://t.co/rvl8ixdvut  "take their money, they can't see" in our case @tcoflondon @sibbymeade @hertspolice a crime against anyone who was targeted as a result of his or her disability or impairment, disability hate crime is majorly on the rise. @sibbymeade &amp; i look forward to working with @hertspolice to catch some bad people. excellent meeting with @hertspolice safer neighbourhoods team pc lyndsey cox re disability hate crime with @sibbymeade today. and will credit @iaindale for my last tweet since i read it on his fb timeline. http://t.co/figcnujc0e no valid complaint here! love the spat between @juliahb1 &amp; @johnprescott http://t.co/figcnujc0e no cause for complaint to @lbc in my view. was a bit of fun. come on! not caught today's papers?
