We automatically infer the values of user attributes such as political orientation or ethnicity  by leveraging observable information such as the user behavior, network structure and the linguistic content of the user’s Twitter feed. We employ a machine learning approach which relies on a comprehensive set of features derived from such user information. We report encouraging experimental results on 3 tasks with different characteristics: political affiliation detection, ethnicity identification and detecting affinity for a particular business. Finally, our analysis shows that rich linguistic features  prove consistently valuable across the 3 tasks and show great promise for additional user classification needs.},

  abstract = {  Online social media are complementing and in some cases replacing
person-to-person social interaction and redefining the diffusion of
information. In particular, microblogs have become crucial grounds on which
public relations, marketing, and political battles are fought. We introduce an
extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion
in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling
massive streams of public microblogging events. We describe a Web service that
leverages this framework to track political memes in Twitter and help detect
astroturfing, smear campaigns, and other misinformation in the context of U.S.
political elections. We present some cases of abusive behaviors uncovered by
our service. Finally, we discuss promising preliminary results on the detection
of suspicious memes via supervised learning based on features extracted from
the topology of the diffusion networks, sentiment analysis, and crowdsourced
annotations.
